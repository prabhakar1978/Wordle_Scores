*Zhong Nanshan (a Chinese pulmonologist who discovered the SARS coronavirus in 2003) suggested simple ways to prevent Wuhan (Covid-19) pneumonia:* 

🔹

My only intention is to pass on information that could help you.  

It is a *simple procedure* that _*kills this virus :_*

👇

_*Rinse your throat by gargling with salt water :_* 
-before going to public places and
-after returning home.

🔹

The method is as follows:

a) a bit of *salt water diluted in a glass;* 

b) lift your head back;  letting the *salt water bathe the area of ​​your throat* 

c) open your mouth slightly and *gargle with salt water* 

d) spit out the salt water after a few seconds.

e) *repeat the process 3 to 5 times* 

🔹

-Because *viruses lurk (wait) in the throat,*  the diluted *Salt Water can Kill them on the spot*, thus achieving the purpose of preventing infection.

🔹

During the SARS, I promoted and supervised this method among my students.  

*As a result, none of our students in our class had a cold, cough and fever.* 

 *This method is simple, effective, easy to do.  But it requires it to be constant.* 

✅

 *Zhong Nanshan, MD.*
 January 29, 2020

✅

 https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhong_Nanshan

🔹

Basically he is advising everybody must *Gargle with SALT WATER DAILY* 3-5 times for Virus Prevention or kill Bacterias*

[4/23/20, 9:33:07 PM] I C E Amma: trnsltn -

‘Japan's professor of Physiology or Medicine, Professor Dr Tasuku Honjo, created a sensation in front of the media today by saying that the corona virus is not natural. if it is natural, it wudn’t hv adversely affected entire world like this. bcoz, as per nature, Temperature is different in different countries. if it is natural, it wud’ve adversely affected only those countries hvg same temperature as China. instead, It is spreading in a country like Switzerland, in the same way it is spreading in the desert areas. whereas if it were natural, it would hv spread in cold places, but died in hot places. I have done 40 years of research on animals and viruses. It is not natural. It is manufactured and the virus is completely artificial. I have worked for 4 years in the wuhan laboratory of China. I am fully acquainted w/all the staff of that laboratory. I have been phoning them all, aftr the Corona accident. but, all their phones r dead for last 3 months. It is now u/stood that all these lab technicians have died.

Based on all my knowledge and research till date, I can say this with 100% confidence that Corona is not natural. It hs not come from bats. China has manufactured it. if what I am saying today is proved false now or even after my death, the government can w/draw my Nobel Prize. but China is lying and this truth will one day be revealed to everyone.’

[8/15/20, 7:06:21 AM] I C E Amma: Rather than wishing Happy Independance Day in advance, I thought I'd share this for you to think over and contemplate:-

The average age of the Army Man is 23 years.  
He is a short haired, tight-muscled kid who, under normal circumstances is considered by society as half man, half boy.

Not yet dry behind the ears, not old enough to buy a beer in the capital of his country, but old enough to die for his country.
 
He's a recent school or college graduate; he was probably an average student from one of the Kendriya Vidyalayas, pursued some form of sport activities, drives a rickety bicycle, and had a girlfriend that either broke up with him when he left for IMA, or swears to be waiting when he returns from half a world away.
 
He listens to rock and roll or hip -hop or bhangra or gazals and a 155mm howitzer.

He is 5 or 7 kilos lighter now than when he was at home because he is working or fighting the insurgents or standing guard on the icy Himalayas from before dawn to well after dusk or he is at Mumbai engaging the terrorists.

He has trouble spelling, thus letter writing is a pain for him, but he can field strip a rifle in 30 seconds and reassemble it in less time in the dark.

He can recite to you the nomenclature of a machine gun or grenade launcher and use either one effectively if he must.

He digs foxholes and latrines and can apply first aid like a professional. 

He can march until he is told to stop, or stop until he is told to march. 

He obeys orders instantly and without hesitation, but he is not without spirit or individual dignity.

His pride and self-respect, he does not lack.
 
He is self-sufficient. 

He has two sets of combat dress: he washes one and wears the other. 

He keeps his water bottle full and his feet dry. 

He sometimes forgets to brush his teeth, but never to clean his rifle.

He can cook his own meals, mend his own clothes, and fix his own wounds. 
 
If you're thirsty, he'll share his water with you; if you are hungry, his food.
He'll even split his ammunition with you in the midst of battle when you run low.
 
He has learned to use his hands like weapons and weapons like they were his hands. 
He can save your life - or take it, because he's been trained for both.

He will often do twice the work of a civilian, draw half the pay, and still find ironic humor in it all. 

He has seen more suffering and death than he should have in his short lifetime.

He has wept in public and in private, for friends who have fallen in combat and is unashamed to do so. 

He feels every note of the Jana Gana Mana vibrate through his body while at rigid attention, while tempering the burning desire to 'square-away' those around him who haven't bothered to stand, remove their hands from their pockets, or even stop talking.

In an odd twist, day in and day out, far from home, he defends their right to be disrespectful.

Just as did his Father, Grandfather, and Great-grandfather, he is paying the price for our freedom. 
 
A tricolour, somewhere in his uniform,
A tricolour, he holds high,
A tricolour he unfurls with pride after every misson.
Sometimes he comes home wrapped in one.
Beardless or not, he is not a boy. 
He is your nation's Fighting Man that has kept this country free and defended your right to Freedom.

He has experienced deprivation and adversity, and has seen his buddies falling to bullets and maimed and blown. 
 
And he smiles at the irony of the IAS babu and politician reducing his status year after year and the unkindest cut of all, even reducing his salary and asking why he should get 14 eggs a week free! And when he silently whispers in protest, the same politician and babu aghast, suggest he's mutinying!
 
Wake up citizens of India! Let's begin discriminating between the saviours of India and destroyers

Are you with the Faujis?

If you are, then share this till it reaches every Patriotic Indian.

I am with Faujis 👨🏻‍🎨👩🏻‍🎨of my country. 

🇮🇳🇮🇳 जय हिंद 🇮🇳🇮🇳

[9/2/20, 11:02:58 AM] Pappu: Online reviews mostly say that  royal care is only interested in money making and not to go there even in emergency.
[9/2/20, 11:03:24 AM] Pappu: Someone said not to go near royal care. Hence checked the reviews
[9/3/20, 5:08:21 AM] Pappu: Anand got admission into kmch

[9/10/20, 7:54:01 PM] Pappu: Apart from allopathy drugs, Anand was given the following during his hospital stay.

Morning and evening kabasura kudineer.

Every meal a cup of sundal plus egg.

Evening murunga keerai soup plus boiled groundnut.
[9/10/20, 7:54:55 PM] Pappu: Kabasura kudineer is a mixture of 14 herbs.
This increases immunity. 
And decreases virus count.
[9/10/20, 7:55:59 PM] Pappu: The government of Tamil Nadu has been openly propogating this. Most households in Tamil Nadu are drinking this daily trying to increase immunity.
[9/10/20, 7:56:20 PM] Pappu: We are drinking this twice a day.

Health secretary in a briefing to Trump: "Sir, in Chennai, India 36 Tamillians have been killed due to Corona Virus"

Trump is silent. His lips quiver. His hands shiver. His eyes wells up. He is unable to speak.

*Health secretary is stunned. She never imagined that this event could affect him so badly*

After a few minutes, in a trembling voice, Trump asks " *So, how many millions are there in one tamillion?*"😜🤪

God asks Bush, "What do you believe in?"

Bush answers, "I believe in the free market, and the strong American nation!"

God is impressed by Bush and tells him, "Great , come sit on the chair on my right" 

Next, God asks Obama, "What do you believe in?"

Obama answers, "I believe in the power of democracy, helping the poor, world peace, etc."

God is really impressed by Obama and tells him, "Well done , come sit on the chair on my left.

Finally, God asks Trump, "What do you believe in?"

Trump answers, "I believe you're sitting on my chair."

[10/20/20, 9:32:53 PM] I C E Amma: A poem for the times we live in 

Never have I seen 
such a mess in life. 

The air is pure but 
wearing a mask is 
mandatory.

Roads are empty 
but it is impossible 
to go on long drive.

People have clean 
hands but there is a 
ban on shaking hands.

Friends have time to 
sit together but they 
cannot get together.

The cook inside you 
is crazy, but you cannot 
call anyone to lunch or 
dinner. 

On every Monday..
the heart longs for the 
office but the weekend 
does not seem to end. 

Those who have money 
have no way to spend it. 

Those who don't have 
money have no way to 
earn it.

There is enough time 
on hand but you can't 
fulfill your dreams. 

The culprit is all around 
but cannot be seen. 

A world full of irony! 
So be positive and 
Stay negative...
 🤲

[11/9/20, 10:14:26 PM] I C E Amma: *🙏👌WHY "TATA" Rules The Heart's Of People...👌🙏*

There is a Blood Bank inside the Tata Motors premises in Jamshedpur (There are Blood Banks in all the other plants as well).
This rule is also applied in Tata Steel too. If you donate a bottle of blood, not only you are given off for that day, but you can also avail an extra leave within 7 days of donating the blood.
So many Employees use it to extend their holidays. So, there is no shortages of leaves ever...!!!
Needless to say, Tata loses several man-hours through this policy.
Once, while having a conversation with the employees of the company, Ratan Tata was asked a question ( by one of the senior official), "People take undue advantage of the policy. We do lose several man-hours due to this. The blood is replenished within 24 hours, you know of it. So Why to give that extra holiday within 7 days of donating blood."
Ratan Tata smiled. As he always does. And then came an extremely calm reply.... *"Encouragement is something I don't need to teach you... Only a few people donate because they want to. Talking about man-hours, we may be losing some man-hours doing that, but have you ever thought of the number of man-hours that get added to the person's life who receives that Blood in the time of Necessity?*
*I am ready to Sacrifice some of our man-hours for the better good of Humanity."*
Ratan Tata is really an inspiring Person and everyone would learn a lot with this..! 

*🙏God Bless Such A Noble Human Being🙏*

[11/25/20, 9:53:34 PM] I C E Amma: 🇨🇭MUST CIRCULATE🇨🇭

Recently, one person was admitted to a nursing home at Ahmedabad, due to severe chest pain. He had an earlier heart attack  in 2015 and was under treatment. The doctors now suggested Angiography. 
  
Upon undergoing Angiography at multi speciality Hospital  Doctors diagnosed multiple blockages for which Angioplasty was ruled out and instead,  suggested 'Bypass Surgery'. 

That evening, he was brought home as  doctor suggested his heart being very weak,due to pumping loss bypass could be performed only after 10 - 15 days. 
  
Meanwhile, after discussing the matter with relatives and close friends, fresh  information came from a family friend. 
  
A new treatment known as-"Enhance External Counter Pulsation" has been introduced into the Indian medical scenario which has got US FDA approval and successfully opted in many country.
  
With this therapy, a patient who has to undergo by-pass need not to do so.

Instead, the patient is given EECP treatment for 35 days in which a machine opens  heart's collateral so natural bypass done.
Cost per session is Rs.2500/-

Currently, only a few doctors in India specialise in this field

One of them is Dr.Anuraga and Dr Ramaswamy. They have a list of patients who had to undergo by-pass from major hospitals; but, instead after undergoing the new treatment, they are absolutely fine and are leading a normal life. 
Doctor's details for your info are:

[11/28/20, 5:37:43 PM] Pappu: Very nice
[11/28/20, 5:37:56 PM] Pappu: You don't have a full length picture?
[11/28/20, 5:38:21 PM] Pappu: She lookd thinner,  is she eating well?
[11/29/20, 9:21:43 AM] Prabha: Yes. She is eating well. We did the 18-month checkup on Nov 20. She is 10.7kg
[11/29/20, 9:22:12 AM] Prabha: 63rd percentile.
[11/29/20, 4:50:22 PM] Pappu: The statistics are just numbers. 
They may not mean anything
[11/29/20, 4:51:03 PM] Pappu: She looks skinny in this picture.  So asked
[11/29/20, 4:51:50 PM] Pappu: If she is eating alright,  then good
[11/29/20, 5:16:41 PM] Pappu: Been wanting to discuss this for over a week.
Mom is getting too old to live alone.
I have been very worried after her fall.
[11/29/20, 5:18:29 PM] Pappu: I came up with 3 options, 
1. I can move into a 3 bedroom flat and mom can move in with us. I will  bear the rent difference.
[11/29/20, 5:21:58 PM] Pappu: 2. I can move in with my family into mom house. I can occupy the older portion and mom can live in the newly constructed portion. 
But some changes need to be done.  Both bathrooms have to be renovated. Unwanted furniture has to be removed to create space for our things. I can bear the cost of renovations and clearing up stuff.
[11/29/20, 5:24:29 PM] Pappu: 3. Another house can be constructed on the terrace. Maybe on one half. I can move in there.
I will bear the cost of it.
I have about 5.5 lakhs in bank deposits.  I can sell my shares and make about 3+ lakhs. I will need to sell gold for about 5 lakhs. This is my plan
[11/29/20, 5:24:59 PM] Pappu: If either of you have any other options,  I am willing to listen
[11/29/20, 6:30:01 PM] Prabha: 4. Pappu can move in  to ground floor. Agreed upon rent money can be given to Amma - this will maintain her financial independence as status quo. Everyone will have extra space and both floors can be occupied. Bathroom renovations, clearing old furniture etc. can still happen
[11/29/20, 6:31:15 PM] Prabha: Maybe we can discuss this on a FaceTime call? Next Saturday or Sunday evening time?
[11/29/20, 6:31:28 PM] Prabha: Pappu, thanks for bringing up the topic.
[11/29/20, 8:13:40 PM] Pappu: I don't want to move into the groundfloor. Multiple reasons

Dear all I am part of a worldwide genomic group with Chinese as leaders. Yesterday we had a meeting on our data on Covid 19 genomics and it was very worrisome to see that the virus has mutated very fast since the first outbreak in spring, in fact now genetically speaking it does not even look like the last virus. In some countries including Pakistan the mutation rate is the highest and I fear it is becoming very deadly, in addition we are seeing it spreading in children. The virus has also very cleverly changed its coat proteins so your immune system can't recognize it anymore. I fear that like previous pandemics such as the Spanish flu we are going to see the maximum deaths in this second wave, so I would suggest extra vigilance and following of SoPs strictly. Also in the light of a lot of false negative and positive results the consensus was to get PCR as well as serology test done but serology can be false also due to viral mutation of its coat proteins, so we have to be extra careful and follow physical distancing as well as wearing masks and washing hands repeatedly.
[12/9/20, 4:42:09 AM] Pappu: I found a house for sale in a gated community. 
It is a duplex house,  with one bedroom in the ground floor.
[12/9/20, 4:42:34 AM] Pappu: I felt this was way better than all the options I had generated earlier
[12/9/20, 4:43:19 AM] Pappu: Mother can live in the ground floor of the house
[12/9/20, 4:44:04 AM] Pappu: This way we all will have enough privacy and mom will have no responsibilities like cleaning, cooking, security etc
[12/9/20, 4:45:48 AM] Pappu: This is a beautiful gated community with many facilities like tennis court, shuttlecock court, basketball court, library, children's park, open ground
[12/9/20, 4:46:00 AM] Pappu: 24 hrs security
[12/9/20, 4:47:38 AM] Pappu: I thought the environment will be good for kids. 
This option satisfies both children and mom. So I insisted on this
[12/9/20, 4:52:30 AM] Pappu: I am going in an hour to finalise the deal with the owner of the house.
[12/9/20, 4:56:36 AM] Pappu: I generated 3 options and  was waiting for mom to discuss her thoughts. She has not said anything.
You said we will all talk weekend.  You didn't send time.
[12/9/20, 4:57:25 AM] Pappu: So I am going with the best option I can see in front of me.
[12/9/20, 4:58:29 AM] Pappu: If I buy that house, the ground floor bedroom will be reserved for mom. She is always welcome.
[12/9/20, 10:09:14 PM] Pappu: Gave advance last night.  Buying the house.
[12/9/20, 10:57:17 PM] I C E Amma: Congratulations 👍👌💐
[12/10/20, 2:57:39 AM] Prabha: Congrats

[12/11/20, 3:36:58 AM] Pappu: Thank you
[12/11/20, 3:37:05 AM] Pappu: Thank you
[12/11/20, 3:38:06 AM] Pappu: The day I went and gave advance for buying house, I cried for more than an hour. I went to bed without dinner and with a terrible headache.
[12/11/20, 3:39:03 AM] Pappu: Mom hurts me too much with her words.
Even as I type this, I am crying
[12/11/20, 3:40:23 AM] Pappu: So I don't want to join in this discussion. 
You and mom talk.
If I join, I will only be left with heartache and headache.
[12/11/20, 3:41:30 AM] Pappu: I have made my stand clear. 
The ground floor bedroom is for mom.
We will all do our best to take care of her.
[12/11/20, 3:42:17 AM] Pappu: We will be moving into the house by March most probably.  So mom has enough time to think about this.

[12/11/20, 6:40:55 AM] I C E Amma: கோவை சாந்தி கியர்ஸ் சுப்பிரமணியம் காலமானார் . ஒரு சீரியல்  நடிகைக்கு கிடைத்த அனுதாபம் கூட இவருக்கு கிடைக்கவில்லை. தமிழக ஊடகங்கள் நிலை இதுதான். இவர் மலிவு விலையில் உணவகம், மருத்துவமனை, மருந்தகம் இவைகளை லாப நோக்கமின்றி செயல்படுத்தி வந்தார்.
🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
கோவை திருச்சி ரோட்டில் கோவை சிங்காநல்லூரில் அமைந்திருக்கும் சாந்தி கேண்டீனில் மதிய சாப்பாடு சாப்பிட சென்றால் அங்கு .......
பிரமாண்டமான சுத்தமான வளாகம். ராணுவக் கட்டுப்பாடு. பார்த்தவுடன் பிரமிப்பை ஏற்படுத்தியது. வரிசையில் நின்று சாப்பாட்டிற்கான டோக்கன் வாங்க வேண்டும்.ஒரு நபருக்கு ரூபாய் 20/- மட்டுமே. எவ்வளவு வேண்டுமானாலும் சாப்பிட்டுக் கொள்ளலாம். பார்சல் கிடையாது. 

அருமையான சாப்பாடு. அங்கு வேலை செய்பவர்களிடம் இயந்திரம் தோற்றுப் போகும். அவ்வளவு வேகம். ஒரு நாளுக்கு மதிய வேளையில் 3000 நபர்களுக்கு சாப்பாடு தயார் செய்து விநியோகிப்பதாக தெரியவந்தது. அதற்கு மேல் கண்டிப்பாக கிடையாது.   

இதனை நிறுவியர் பெயர் உயர்திரு பி.சுப்பிரமணியம் அவர்கள். சாந்தி கியர்ஸ் அதிபர்  என்றால் அனைவருக்கும் தெரியும். அவரது மனைவியின் பெயர் திருமதி சாந்தி. தனது மனைவியின் நினைவாக சாந்தி சோஷியல் சர்வீஸஸ் என்ற பெயரில் இதனை அவர் நடத்தி வருகிறார். 

தமிழகத்தில் தரமான உணவுகளை இவர்கள் அளவிற்கு எந்த உயர்தர உணவகமும் கொடுக்க முடியாது என்பது மறுக்க முடியாத உண்மை. ரூ.20-க்கு முழுச் சாப்பாடு, ரூ.5 முதல் ரூ.15-க்கு டிபன் வகைகள், பில்டர் காபி, டீ, ராகி பால், சத்து மாவு பால் என்று எதைத் தேர்ந்தெடுத்து சாப்பிட்டாலும் விலை ரூ.5 தான். நாம் மூன்று வேளையும், கொலைப் பசியில் சாப்பிட்டாலும் பில் நூறு ரூபாய் ஆகாது. இதனால், இந்த பகுதியில் வாடகைக்கு வீடு கிடைப்பது அரிது. அங்கு குடியிருப்பவர்கள் அந்த வீடுகளில் சமையல் செய்வதும் கிடையாது.

ஏழைகள் மற்றும் முதியோர்களுக்கென தனி உணவு விடுதியுள்ளது. அங்கு அவர்களுக்கு இலவசமாகவே உணவு வழங்கப்படுகிறது என்பது விசேஷ செய்தி.

உணவில் மட்டுமல்லாமல், கல்வி, பெட்ரோல், டீசல், பார்மஸி, டயாலிஸிஸ் சேவை, ரத்த வங்கி சேவை, கண் கண்ணாடி கடை, ரேடியோலஜி சேவை, ஆய்வு மையம், எரிவாயு எரியூட்டு மையம் என்று பல சேவைகளை செய்து வருகிறார்கள்.  இந்த வளாகத்திலுள்ள மருத்துவ ஆய்வகத்தில் எடுக்கப்படும் ஸ்கேன், எக்ஸ்ரே உள்ளிட்டவை மற்ற மையங்களைவிட, 50 முதல் 70 % கட்டணம் குறைவு. 

இந்த அனைத்துப் புகழுக்கும் காரணம் இதன் நிறுவனர் சுப்பிரமணியம். ஆனால், வலது கை கொடுப்பது, இடது கைக்குத் தெரியக் கூடாது என்று சொல்வதைப் போல, இதுவரை தன்னை எங்கேயும் இவர் அடையாளப்படுத்திக் கொண்டது இல்லை. பெரும்பாலான ஊடகங்கள் அவரைச் சந்தித்துப் பேட்டியெடுக்க முயற்சி செய்தன. ஆனால், அவர் எந்த ஊடகத்தையும் சந்திக்கவுமில்லை. பேட்டி கொடுக்கவுமில்லை. எங்குமே அவர்கள் புகைப்படம் இருக்காது. இன்டர்நெட்டில் தேடினால் கூட அவரது புகைப்படம் கிடைக்காது.

ஒரு அரசு தன் மக்களுக்கு செய்ய வேண்டிய பணிகளை சத்தமே இல்லாமல் சுத்தமாக செய்து வந்த சுப்பிரமணியம் அவர்களை பாராட்ட வார்த்தைகளில்லை.

முகத்தையும் காட்டாமல், முகவரியையும் தெரிவிக்காமல் பல லட்சம் மக்களின் வாழ்த்துகளை வாங்கிக் கொண்டிருக்கிறது சுப்பிரமணியத்தின் குடும்பம். நல்ல மனம் வாழ்க...!

மேலும் இங்கு பல்வேறு வகையான சிற்றுண்டிகளும் விற்கப்படுகின்றன. மைதாமாவில் எந்தவிதமான பதார்த்தங்களும் செய்வதில்லை. 

காலை 4.30 மணி முதல் 200க்கும் மேற்பட்டோர் நடைபெயற்சியில் ஈடுபட்டு வருகிறார்கள். பிறகு
6 மணி முதல் கம்பங்கூல், சூப் (அருகம்புல், கீரை, மனத்தக்காளி மற்றும் பல) மற்றும் ஜூஸ் (மாதுளை, முருங்கை, கேரட் மற்றும் பல) அனைத்தும் 5 ரூபாய்க்கு ஒரு டம்ளர் என்று விற்பனை செய்கிறார்கள். 

களி, சுண்டல், முளைகட்டிய பயிர்களும் விற்கிறார்கள்.
அனைத்தும் சுத்தமாகவும், அளவில் அதிகமாகவும், விலை குறைவாகவும் கொடுக்கிறார்கள்.

முக்கியமாக ஒரே நேரத்தில் குறைந்தது 200 குழந்தைகள் விளையாடும் அளவிற்கு விளையாட்டுக் கருவிகளும், பெரிய விளையாட்டுத்திடலும்  உள்ளது.

மேலும் 5 கிலோ மீட்டர் சுற்றளவில்
5 மழலையர் பள்ளிகள் 
(PRE KG, LKG, UKG) இலவசமாக நடத்திக்கொண்டிருக்கிறார்.
இங்கு பயிலும் 
அனைத்து குழந்தைகளுக்கும் காலையில் சிறப்பான சிற்றுண்டியும், இடைவேளையில் பாலும்-சுண்டலும்,
மதியம் மிக உயர்தரமான மதிய உணவும் இலவசமாக கொடுத்துக் கொண்டிருக்கிறார்.

மேலும் இங்கிருக்கும் பார்மசியில் குறைந்தது நூறு பேராவது வேலை செய்கிறார்கள் என்றால் அது எவ்வளவு பெரிய பார்மசி என்று நீங்களே கற்பனை செய்து கொள்ளுங்கள். மருந்துகளுக்கு 
20 முதல் 25% வரை சிறப்புத் தள்ளுபடியும் கொடுக்கிறார்கள்.

மருந்து வாங்க வருபவர்கள் டோக்கனை பெற்றுக்கொண்டு வரிசையில் அமர்ந்து கொண்டு இருந்தால், டோக்கன் நம்பர் எதிர்புறம் இருக்கும் டிவி ஸ்கிரீனில் ஸ்கோரலாக ஓடுகிறது. மருந்தினைப் பெற்றுக்கொள்ள 10 கவுன்டர்கள் உள்ளன. முதியோர்களுக்கு சிறப்பு தனி கவுன்டரும் உள்ளன. 

கோவையில் எரிவாயு மூலம் எறியூட்டும் மையத்தை முதன்முதலில்  ஏற்படுத்தியுள்ளார். எரியூட்டும் மையத்திலிருந்து 15Km தொலைவிற்கு Freezer box-ம், அமரர் ஊர்தியும் இலவசமே. எரியூட்டும் மையத்திற்கான கட்டணம் Rs.1000 மட்டுமே.

இவர்களைப் பற்றி இன்னமும் அறிந்து கொள்ள

அவரது ஆத்மா சாந்தி அடைய பிரார்த்தனை செய்வோம்.

[12/18/20, 7:55:20 AM] I C E Amma: 7 short stories that made me blink back my tears...

🌾 *LOOKING BACK*
I interviewed my grandmother for part of a research paper I’m working on for my Psychology class. When I asked her to define success in her own words, she said, “Success is when you look back at your life and the memories make you smile."

🌾 *LOVE CONQUERS PAIN*
After I watched my dog get run over by a car, I sat on the side of the road holding him and crying. And just before he died, he licked the tears off my face.

🌾 *TOGETHERNESS*
As my father, three brothers, and two sisters stood around my mother’s hospital bed, my mother uttered her last coherent words before she died. She simply said, “I feel so loved right now. We should have gotten together like this more often.”

🌾 *AFFECTION*
I kissed my dad on the forehead as he passed away in a small hospital bed. About 5 seconds after he passed, I realized it was the first time I had given him a kiss since I was a little boy.

🌾 *JOY*
When I witnessed a 27-year-old cancer patient laughing hysterically at her 2-year-old daughter’s antics, I suddenly realized that I need to stop complaining about my life and start celebrating it again.

🌾 *KINDNESS*
A boy in a wheelchair saw me desperately struggling on crutches with my broken leg and offered to carry my backpack and books for me. He helped me all the way across campus to my class and as he was leaving he said, “I hope you feel better soon.”

🌾 *SHARING*
I was traveling in Kenya and I met a refugee from Zimbabwe. He said he hadn’t eaten anything in over 3 days and looked extremely skinny and unhealthy. Then my friend offered him the rest of the sandwich he was eating. The first thing the man said was, “We can share it.”

*Celebrate Life with Gratitude*

[1/13/21, 2:06:49 AM] I C E Amma: MY MOTHER...
 
This is a truly BEAUTIFUL piece please read this at a slow pace, digesting every word at leisure...do not hurry....this is a treasure...

For those lucky to still be blessed with your Mom, this is beautiful

For those of us who aren't, this is even more beautiful. For those who are moms, you'll love this.
 
The young Mother set her foot on the path of life. "Is this the long way?" she asked. 

And the Guide said:  "Yes, and the way is hard. And you will be old before you reach the end of it.

But the end will be better than the beginning." But the young Mother was happy, and she would not believe that anything could be better than these years. 

So she played with her children, and gathered flowers for them along the way, and bathed them in the clear streams; and the sun shone on them, and the young Mother cried,

"Nothing will ever be lovelier than this." 

Then the night came, and the storm, and the path was dark, and the children shook with fear and cold, and the mother drew them close and covered them with her mantle, and the children said, 

"Mother, we are not afraid, for you are near, and nothing can harm us."

And the morning came, and there was a hill ahead, and the children climbed and grew weary, and the mother was weary. 

But at all times she said to the children," A little patience and we are there." So the children climbed, and when they reached the top they said,

"Mother, we would not have made it without you." 

And the Mother, when she lay down at night looked up at the stars and said,"This is a better day than the last, for my children have learned fortitude in the face of hardness. 

Yesterday I gave them courage. Today, I've given them strength." 

And the next day came strange clouds, which darkened the earth, clouds of war and hate and evil, and the children groped and stumbled, and the mother said: "Look up. Lift your eyes to the light."

And the children looked and saw above the clouds an everlasting glory, and it guided them beyond the darkness. And that night the Mother said,

"This is the best day of all, for I have shown my children God."

And the days went on, and the weeks and the months and the years, and the mother grew old and she was little and bent. 

But her children were tall and strong, and walked with courage. And when the way was rough, they lifted her, for she was as light as a feather; and at last they came to a hill, and beyond they could see a shining road and golden gates flung wide. 

And Mother said,"I have reached the end of my journey.

And now I know the end is better than the beginning, for my children can walk alone, and their children after them."

 And the children said, 

"You will always walk with us, Mother, even when you have gone through the gates." 

And they stood and watched her as she went on alone, and the gates closed after her.  And they said: 

"We cannot see her but she is with us still.

A Mother like ours is more than a memory.  She is a living presence......" Your Mother is always with you.... 

She's the whisper of the leaves as you walk down the street; she's the smell of bleach in your freshly laundered socks; she's the cool hand on your brow when you're not well. 

Your Mother lives inside your laughter. And she's crystallised in every teardrop.

She's the place you came from, your first home; and she's the map you follow with every step you take. 

She's your first love and your first heartbreak, and nothing on earth can separate you'll. Not time, not space... not even death!

PASS THIS ON TO ALL THE MOTHERS AND CHILDREN YOU KNOW. MAY WE NEVER TAKE OUR MOTHERS FOR GRANTED NO MATTER WHAT...

[3/26/21, 10:43:18 PM] I C E Amma: It was the first time I heard the term "cloud avalanche" and I saw "cloud avalanche" in the video for the first time. Recently, a "cloud avalanche" occurred near the Kapuche Glacier Lake in the mountains of Nepal. That scene is really rare, it's lucky enough to see it once in a lifetime.
At that time, a group of travel companions were camping by the lake, and they took the risk of taking pictures of this rare visual feast.

The white snow clouds rushed down the valley, unstoppable, instantly swallowing the mountains and hitting the lake surface. Against the backdrop of the blue sky and the yellow-brown mountains, they were more distinct, magnificent and shocking. The strong air flow overturned the tents and sleeping bags, frightening the travellers to evade in panic, but fortunately no casualties were reported.After that, a small rainbow appeared by the lake, which was extremely beautiful, and the fellow travellers all cheered and marveled. Call it "perfect cloud collapse"
[3/28/21, 12:46:59 AM] I C E Amma: Really worth a read.
This is an article that  has caused many to reflect over their own lives. The author is a retired writer, and she expressed emotion when she was about to go to a nursing home.

(Originally written in Chinese)

I'm going to a nursing home. I have to. When life gets to where you are no longer able to take care of yourself completely, your children are busy at work and have to take care of their children and have no time to take care of you, this seems to be the only way out.

The nursing home is in good condition, with clean single rooms equipped with simple and practical electrical appliances. All kinds of entertainment facilities are complete, the food is fairly delicious, the service is also very good. The environment is also very beautiful, but the price is not cheap.

My pension is poorly able to  support this. But I have my own house. If I sell it, then money is not a problem. I can spend it on retirement, and the rest will be left as an inheritance for my son. The son understands very well: "your money and your property should be enjoyed by you, don't worry about us." 
Now I have to consider preparing to go to a nursing home.

As the saying goes: Breaking a family is worth tens of thousands, which refers to many things. Boxes, bags, cabinets, and drawers are filled with all kinds of daily necessities: clothings for all weathers and beddings for all seasons.

I like to collect. I have collected a lot of stamps. I have also hundreds of purple clay tea pots. There are many small collections, and such small items as pendants of emerald and walnut amber, and two small yellow croakers. I am.specially fond of books. The bookshelves on the wall are full.

There are also dozens of bottles of good foreign wine. There are full sets of household appliances; various cooking utensils, pots and pans,  rice, oil, salt, noodles, flour,spices, various seasonings, in fact the kitchen is also full. There are also dozens and  dozens of photo albums..., looking at the house full of things, I'm worried!

The nursing home has only one room with a cabinet, a table, a bed, a sofa, a refrigerator, a washing machine, a TV, an induction cooker and a microwave oven -- all the things I will really need. There is no place to store the wealth that I have accumulated throughout my life.

At this moment, I suddenly feel that my so-called wealth is superfluous, and it doesn't belong to me. I just take a look at it, play with it, use it. It actually belongs to this world. The wealth that come in turns are just passing by. Whose palace is the Forbidden City? The Emperor thought it belonged to him, but today it belongs to the people and society.

You look at these, you play with these, you use these but you can't take them with you in death.

I really want to donate the things in my house, but I can’t get it done. To deal with it has now become a problem. Very few children and grandchildren can appreciate what I have collected. I can imagine what it will be like when my children and grandchildren face with these painstakingly accumulated treasures of mine: all the clothes and bedding will be thrown away; dozens of precious photos will be destroyed; books will be sold as scrap. Collections? If you are not interested, you will dispose of them. The mahogany furniture is not practical and will be sold at a low price.

Just like the end of the Red Mansion: only a piece of white left, so clean.

Facing with the mountain of clothes, I only picked a few favourites; I only kept a set of pots and pans for kitchen supplies, a few books that are worth reading; a handful of teapots for tea. Bring along my ID card, senior citizen certificate, health insurance card, household register, and of course a bank card. Enough!

It's all my belongings!  I'm gone. I bid farewell to my neighbours, I knelt down at the door and bowed three times and gave this home back to the world.

Yes! In life, you can only sleep in one bed, live in one room. Any more of it is merely for watching and playing!

Having lived a lifetime, people finally understand: we don’t really need much. Don’t be shackled by superfluous things to be happy!

It's ridiculous to compete for fame and fortune. Life is no more than a bed.

*Not only people over 60 years old but once you start to understand this fact, shouldnt one think carefully about how to prepare well ahead of time for the last journey in life?  Let go of fantasies and baggage, and of those things that can't be eaten, worn, used. Be healthy and be happy*

Very practical and true yet one is not able to let go. So it is an important art to let go.

👆🌹🙏🌹Such a beautiful expression of truth, as it is happening to many of us and will happen to our children after that and then will hapen to our grandchildren and so on.

It is the neverending story of life, the mystery of which none have unfolded yet. 🙏

[4/2/21, 12:01:21 PM] I C E Amma: Hi everyone , 

I’m reviewing the rapidly increasing cases of COVID in KMCH . ESI hospital is reportedly full . KMCH and PSG is rapidly filling . Cases are surging faster then last time . 

My official recommendation is to go to virtual for next month or 2 and put fellowship/socials on hold . 

I would also suggest you forward this to other groups

- Arun Palaniswami

From KMCH Doctors' group 👇👇👇👇

The virus is back, this time with more energy, tactics and camouflage.
We don't cough
No fever, it's joint pain, weakness,
Loss of appetite and Covid pneumonia!
Of course, the death rate is higher, it takes less time to get to the extreme. Sometimes no symptoms ... let's be careful ...
 The strain is not domiciled in our nasopharyngeal region!
 It directly affects the lungs, which means window periods are shortened.
I have seen a number of patients without fever, but an x-ray report shows moderate chest pneumonia!
The nasal swab is often negative for COVID19!

There are more and more false pharyngeal nasal tests COVID19) ... which means that the virus spreads directly to the lungs causing acute respiratory distress due to viral pneumonia! This explains why it has become acute and more fatal !!!


Be careful, avoid crowded places, wear a face mask, wash our hands often.

*WAVE* more deadly than the first.  So we have to be very careful and *take every precaution.*
 Please become an alert communicator among friends and family ...

[5/7/21, 7:57:53 AM] Pappu: During a brutal study at Harvard in the 1950s, Dr. Curt Richter placed rats in a pool of water to test how long they could tread water.

On average they'd give up and sink after 15 minutes.
But right before they gave up due to exhaustion, the researchers would pluck them out, dry them off, let them rest for a few minutes - and put them back in for a second round.
In this second try - how long do you think they lasted?
Remember - they had just swam until failure only a few short minutes ago...
How long do you think?
Another 15 minutes?
10 minutes?
5 minutes?
No!
60 hours!
That's not an error.

That's right! 60 hours of swimming.
The conclusion drawn was that since the rats BELIEVED that they would eventually be rescued, they could push their bodies way past what they previously thought impossible.

I will leave you with this thought:
If HOPE can cause exhausted rats to swim for that long, what could a BELIEF in yourself and your abilities, do for you?

So let’s inject HOPE in people that this will pass and we can win over situation. 
HOPE IS DECISION!!! 
If we decide not be defeated then we can’t get defeated!!! 
So let’s inject HOPE in everyone’s life!!!



Absolutely right. It changes the behavior of trillions of cells in our system. So, let us all be happy, positive and optimistic.😄😄😄👍

 *THE BRAIN OF AN ELDERLY PERSON*

The director of the George Washington University College of Medicine argues that the brain of an elderly person is much more plastic than is commonly believed. At this age, the interaction of the right and left hemispheres of the brain becomes harmonious, which expands our creative possibilities. That is why among people over 60 you can find many personalities who have just started their creative activities.

 Of course, the brain is no longer as fast as it was in youth. However, it wins in flexibility. That is why, with age, we are more likely to make the right decisions and are less exposed to negative emotions. The peak of human intellectual activity occurs at about 70 years old, when the brain begins to work at full strength.

 Over time, the amount of myelin in the brain increases, a substance that facilitates the rapid passage of signals between neurons. Due to this, intellectual abilities are increased by 300% compared to the average.

 And the peak of active production of this substance falls on 60-80 years of age. Also interesting is the fact that after 60 years, a person can use 2 hemispheres at the same time. This allows you to solve much more complex problems.

 Professor Monchi Uri from the University of Montreal believes that the brain of an elderly person chooses the least energy-intensive path, cutting unnecessary and leaving only the right options for solving the problem. A study was conducted in which different age groups took part. Young people were confused a lot when passing the tests, while those over 60 made the right decisions.

 Now let's look at the features of the brain at the age of 60-80. They are really rosy.

FEATURES OF THE BRAIN OF AN ELDERLY PERSON.

 1. The neurons of the brain do not die off, as everyone around them says. Connections between them simply disappear if a person does not engage in mental work.

 2. Absent-mindedness and forgetfulness appear due to an overabundance of information. Therefore, you do not need to focus your whole life on unnecessary trifles.

 3. Beginning at the age of 60, a person, when making decisions, uses not one hemisphere at the same time, like young people, but both.

4. Conclusion: if a person leads a healthy lifestyle, moves, has a feasible physical activity and has full mental activity, intellectual abilities DO NOT decrease with age, but only GROW, reaching a peak by the age of 80-90 years.

 So don't be afraid of old age. Strive to develop intellectually. Learn new crafts, make music, learn to play musical instruments, paint pictures! Dance! Take an interest in life, meet and communicate with friends, make plans for the future, travel as best you can. Don't forget to go to shops, cafes, concerts. Do not lock yourself alone - it is destructive for any person. Live with the thought: all the good things are still ahead of me!

👀 Information!

  A large study in the United States found that:

  ▪The most productive age of a person is from 60 to 70 years;
  ▪ The 2nd most productive human stage is the age from 70 to 80 years old;
  ▪ 3rd most productive stage - 50 and 60 years old.
  ▪ Before that, the person has not yet reached his peak.
  ▪The average age of the Nobel Prize laureates is 62;
  ▪The average age of the presidents of the 100 largest companies in the world is 63 years;
  ▪The average age of pastors in the 100 largest churches in the United States is 71;
  ▪The average age of dads is 76 years.
  ▪ This confirms that a person's best and most productive years are between 60 and 80 years of age.
  ▪This study was published by a team of doctors and psychologists in the NEW ENGLAND JOURNAL OF MEDICINE.
  ▪They found that at 60 you reach the peak of your emotional and mental potential, and this continues until you are 80.
  ▪ Therefore, if you are 60, 70 or 80 years old, you are at the best level of your life.

Pass on this  information to your family and friends aged 60, 70 and 80 so that they will be proud of their age!

🎅

✍written by 
a class of 7-year-olds
👦🏻👧🏻
You'll love it... 

😘Grandma is 
a lady  
who has no little children of her own because they are all grown up. 

😘She likes other people's children.

😘A grandmother  is a woman, and an intelligent  lady!       
  
😘 A grandma has a special relationship with God that she is proud of 

😘Grandma s don't have to do anything except be there when we come to see her. 

😘She s old and shouldn't play hard or run.  

😘It is good if she drives us to the shops and give us money. 

😘When she takes us for walks, they slow down past things like pretty leaves and caterpillars. 

😘She shows us and talk to us about the colors of the flowers and also why we shouldn't step on 'cracks.' 

😘They don't say, 'Hurry up.' 

😘Usually they are so clever they know all answers ... 

😘She wears glasses and smart dresses 

😘She can take her teeth  out. 

😘Grandma show the greatest love than our parents. 

😘When she reads to us, she does n't skip.  

😘She does n't mind if we ask for the same story over again. 

😘Everybody should try to have a grandmother, especially if you don't have television because they are the only grownups who like to spend time with us...

😘She knows if we should have snack time before bed time.

😘She say prayers with us and kiss us even when we've acted bad. 

😘Grandma is the smartest woman on earth!  

😘She teaches me good things, but I don't get to see her enough to get as smart as she is.

[11/10/21, 12:43:39 AM] I C E Amma: #kidsalert post # santizerawareness

Hi all, 

I want to share the incident happened to my son 6 days ago. My hubby took my son to a dental clinic on that day, while he was registering in the reception, my son wanted to wash hands in sanitizer which was in a pedal stand. He pressed the pedal hard . The sanitizer splashed on his right eye. He was crying a loud by closing his right eye in his hand, my hubby wonderjng wat happened and later realized it is sanitizer. Immediately washed with lots of water and came home. We then immediately went to another hospital and checked with paediatric. They consulted eye doctor over the phone and gave eye drops. My son had pain, irritation for hours even after washing with lots of water multiple times. We came home very late in the night from hospital. He didn't sleep properly that day night. We took him next day morning to Aravind eye hospital, poonamallee. They checked and said the first layer is burnt and there is a wound. By god's grace one good info was shared that the layer will form again like our body skin. It will take some days to recover and new skin to form. Contact lenses provided for 5 days for not getting infected. And now he is on eye drops. Another 2 more weeks to go for revision in hospital. We have been continuously asking our son to read through his right eye, God's grace he is able to read. Me and my hubby was feeling guilty and hurt very bad, couldn't express wat we were going through mentally. Still his eyes are little red, swollen. 

I warn all the parents to take care of your kids. Kids are kids, even if we train them. Don't allow them to use sanitizer on their own. 

Now schools are reopening, I heard some schools r asking to bring sanitizer as well. Please inform your school management as well  and request for changes. 

I don't want any kid to go through such bad incident. I don't want any parent to go through this mental depression. 

Please please spread this awareness. Share with your neighbors, friends, relatives, schools etc etc.

[11/21/21, 11:08:50 PM] I C E Amma: An India that Vir Das forgot ... But then, will this sell?

" India has 70 unicorns today, more than 40% of which got created in the last 9 months. 90% of these unicorns are less than 10 years old, 70% of which are less than 5 years old. 

UPI, India’s cashless payment ecosystem does more than 50% of all real-time payments volume in India, about 45 Billion payments worth $100 Billion in value annually, launched just 5 years back. Visa and MasterCard are both about 70 years old do less than 10%, combined. 

Zerodha, India’s biggest stock trading app has approximately 61% of its users under the age of 28. 

India has 100 million crypto accounts, highest in the world, next is USA with 27 Million. Half of them have never traded equity. 

India’s FoodTech has 2 decacorns, at least 3 privately valued unicorns, more getting funded and growing everyday. 

Indian funded EdTech is probably valued at over $100 Billion dollars today, if not more, growing at 25-35% every year. 

India’s D2C ecosystem has multiple unicorns, very soon we will lose count in this space, given the fervour. 

Between Cred, BharatPe, and RazorPay, India’s private fintech infrastructure is sorted. All multi Billion unicorns. Average age of which is about 5 years. 

Indian SAAS has both privately owned and privately funded decacorns, growing and starting up like never before, from India’s largest and small towns alike. FreshWorks recently debuted at $13 Billion in Nasdaq. 

India’s Ecommerce market is growing at 30%+ almost every year, assumed to be at $ 100 Billion in value soon, private valuation of incumbent players is probably way more $250 Billion.  

India’s electric vehicle market is appreciating in triple digit percentages, in both business and consumer use cases. Ola Electric is said to be raising at $ 5 Billion valuation. It is 3 years old. 

India has 238 Billionaires this year, it had 58 last year. The youngest of which is 23 years old, 15% or 3 years younger than the one last year, is of course a technology entrepreneur. 

Byju’s Raveendran and family is worth at least $ 3.5 Billion dollars, who started the tech version of Byju’s in 2011, is richer than Anand Mahindra, whose company started in 1945. 

PharmEasy, a medtech startup which started less than 7 years back, bought India’s largest diagnostic company that started 25 years back, in my mind will be India’s first decacorn IPO from medtech space in India. 

India space startups can launch your payload in under 15 days across 25 locations globally. We can choose the configurations like location, inclination, and mass, over a website. 

Are you going to watch by the sidelines as India becomes what it always wanted to be or will you join the people who are changing how India and the world operate? Doesn’t matter if it you are a founder, investor, or employee. 

Will you keep complaining or be a part of the change that is unmissable and clearly once in many a lifetimes? 

The choice is yours, and so is your story. You get to write it. Hope you write it well. "

[11/26/21, 5:09:54 AM] I C E Amma: A mother casually calls up her son one afternoon.

*Mother*: "Hi son, how are you?"

*Son*: "I'm fine, Mom".

*Mother*: "What did you have for lunch today?"

*Son*: Don't you have anything else to ask, Mom?

You only ask silly questions like, 
'What did you eat?' ...'
What dress are you wearing?'...
'Whom did you meet.'....
'What song did you listen to?'...etc etc!

*Mother*: "Oh!!!! Ok, Ok, then tell me, 

how should  the World Bank fight these inflationary trends with minimum intervention in the money markets? 

And what should be the role of the International Finance Institutions to control inflationary trends across the globe & the slowing down of the World Economy?"

*Son*: (After a few seconds silence)....

"Mom, I had curd rice with pickle & salad."

*_Dedicated to all kids who underestimate their mothers._!*😃👍

Enlarge the pictures & touch the birds, you can  listen their tunes    🦜🦜🦜
Just enlarge  the frame to see the birds clearly.

*TAP* ( *only !*, don’t press to long) any bird and you'll hear its call.

Enjoy ! 🦜🦜🦜

[12/25/21, 9:55:02 PM] I C E Amma: *MY MOTHER...*
 
This is a truly BEAUTIFUL piece please read this at a slow pace, digesting every word at leisure...do not hurry....this is a treasure...

For those lucky to still be blessed with your Mom, this is beautiful.

For those of us who aren't, this is even more beautiful. 

For those who are moms, you'll love this.
 
The young Mother set her foot on the path of life. "Is this the long way?" she asked. 

And the Guide said:  "Yes, and the way is hard. And you will be old before you reach the end of it.

But the end will be better than the beginning." But the young Mother was happy, and she would not believe that anything could be better than these years. 

So she played with her children, and gathered flowers for them along the way, and bathed them in the clear streams; and the sun shone on them, and the young Mother cried,

"Nothing will ever be lovelier than this." 

Then the night came, and the storm, and the path was dark, and the children shook with fear and cold, and the mother drew them close and covered them with her mantle, and the children said, 

"Mother, we are not afraid, for you are near, and nothing can harm us."

And the morning came, and there was a hill ahead, and the children climbed and grew weary, and the mother was weary. 

But at all times she said to the children," A little patience and we are there." So the children climbed, and when they reached the top they said,

"Mother, we would not have made it without you." 

And the Mother, when she lay down at night looked up at the stars and said,"This is a better day than the last, for my children have learned fortitude in the face of hardness. 

Yesterday I gave them courage. Today, I've given them strength." 

And the next day came strange clouds, which darkened the earth, clouds of war and hate and evil, and the children groped and stumbled, and the mother said: "Look up. Lift your eyes to the light."

And the children looked and saw above the clouds an everlasting glory, and it guided them beyond the darkness. And that night the Mother said,

"This is the best day of all, for I have shown my children God."

And the days went on, and the weeks and the months and the years, and the mother grew old and she was little and bent. 

But her children were tall and strong, and walked with courage. And when the way was rough, they lifted her, for she was as light as a feather; and at last they came to a hill, and beyond they could see a shining road and golden gates flung wide. 

And Mother said,"I have reached the end of my journey.

And now I know the end is better than the beginning, for my children can walk alone, and their children after them."

 And the children said, 

"You will always walk with us, Mother, even when you have gone through the gates." 

And they stood and watched her as she went on alone, and the gates closed after her.  And they said: 

"We cannot see her but she is with us still.

A Mother like ours is more than a memory.  She is a living presence......" Your Mother is always with you.... 

She's the whisper of the leaves as you walk down the street; she's the smell of bleach in your freshly laundered socks; she's the cool hand on your brow when you're not well. 

Your Mother lives inside your laughter. And she's crystallised in every teardrop.

She's the place you came from, your first home; and she's the map you follow with every step you take. 

She's your first love and your first heartbreak, and nothing on earth can separate you'll. Not time, not space... not even death!

*PASS THIS ON TO ALL THE MOTHERS AND CHILDREN YOU KNOW. MAY WE NEVER TAKE OUR MOTHERS FOR GRANTED NO MATTER WHAT...*

[2/6/22, 3:51:18 AM] I C E Amma: MY MOTHER...
 
This is a truly BEAUTIFUL piece please read this at a slow pace, digesting every word at leisure...do not hurry....this is a treasure...

For those lucky to still be blessed with your Mom, this is beautiful

For those of us who aren't, this is even more beautiful. For those who are moms, you'll love this.
 
The young Mother set her foot on the path of life. "Is this the long way?" she asked. 

And the Guide said:  "Yes, and the way is hard. And you will be old before you reach the end of it.

But the end will be better than the beginning." But the young Mother was happy, and she would not believe that anything could be better than these years. 

So she played with her children, and gathered flowers for them along the way, and bathed them in the clear streams; and the sun shone on them, and the young Mother cried,

"Nothing will ever be lovelier than this." 

Then the night came, and the storm, and the path was dark, and the children shook with fear and cold, and the mother drew them close and covered them with her mantle, and the children said, 

"Mother, we are not afraid, for you are near, and nothing can harm us."

And the morning came, and there was a hill ahead, and the children climbed and grew weary, and the mother was weary. 

But at all times she said to the children," A little patience and we are there." So the children climbed, and when they reached the top they said,

"Mother, we would not have made it without you." 

And the Mother, when she lay down at night looked up at the stars and said,"This is a better day than the last, for my children have learned fortitude in the face of hardness. 

Yesterday I gave them courage. Today, I've given them strength." 

And the next day came strange clouds, which darkened the earth, clouds of war and hate and evil, and the children groped and stumbled, and the mother said: "Look up. Lift your eyes to the light."

And the children looked and saw above the clouds an everlasting glory, and it guided them beyond the darkness. And that night the Mother said,

"This is the best day of all, for I have shown my children God."

And the days went on, and the weeks and the months and the years, and the mother grew old and she was little and bent. 

But her children were tall and strong, and walked with courage. And when the way was rough, they lifted her, for she was as light as a feather; and at last they came to a hill, and beyond they could see a shining road and golden gates flung wide. 

And Mother said,"I have reached the end of my journey.

And now I know the end is better than the beginning, for my children can walk alone, and their children after them."

 And the children said, 

"You will always walk with us, Mother, even when you have gone through the gates." 

And they stood and watched her as she went on alone, and the gates closed after her.  And they said: 

"We cannot see her but she is with us still.

A Mother like ours is more than a memory.  She is a living presence......" Your Mother is always with you.... 

She's the whisper of the leaves as you walk down the street; she's the smell of bleach in your freshly laundered socks; she's the cool hand on your brow when you're not well. 

Your Mother lives inside your laughter. And she's crystallised in every teardrop.

She's the place you came from, your first home; and she's the map you follow with every step you take. 

She's your first love and your first heartbreak, and nothing on earth can separate you'll. Not time, not space... not even death!

PASS THIS ON TO ALL THE MOTHERS AND CHILDREN YOU KNOW. MAY WE NEVER TAKE OUR MOTHERS FOR GRANTED NO MATTER WHAT...

[3/26/22, 10:40:29 PM] I C E Amma: All My Dear friends!  Upto which table do you know? 

At least Upto 10, awesome! 

You have crossed the mountain! 😀😁🙂

Don't worry for the rest of the tables! 

From 10th to 99th, any table,  very easy! 

I didn't know this. Because this vedic mathematics was not taught to us in school of our own country! 

How to write Table of any two digit number?

For example Table of  *87*

First write down *table of 8 then write down table of 7 beside it*

08     0 7   (08+0)       87
------------------------------------
16     1 4   (16+1)   174
24     2 1   (24+2)     261
32     2 8   (32+2)     348
40     3 5    (40+3)    435

*அமெரிக்கா நமக்குப் பாடமாக அமையட்டும்*

*வீடுகளில் சமைப்பது நின்ற அமெரிக்காவில் என்ன நடந்தது ?*

*1980-ல் புகழ் பெற்ற அமெரிக்க பொருளாதார நிபுணர்கள்.*

*சமையல் அறையை தனியார் கம்பெனிகளுக்கு கொடுத்தாகிவிட்டது,  வயதானவர்கள் குழந்தைகள் பராமரிப்பை அரசாங்கத்துக்கு கொடுத்துவிட்டால், குடும்பப் பொறுப்பும், பாங்கும் அழிந்துவிடும்”  என்று தீர்க்கதரிசனமாகக் கூறினார்கள்.*

*அதாவது வீட்டில் சமைப்பது நிறுத்தி விட்டு,*

*கடைகளில் வாங்கி கொள்ளும் பழக்கம் வந்தது இதனால் அவர்கள் எச்சரித்தபடியே பொறுப்பும் பாங்கும் அற்ற அமெரிக்க குடும்பங்கள் ஏறக்குறைய அழிந்துவிட்டன.*

*அன்புடன் சமைப்பது என்பது பாசத்துடன் குடும்பத்தை இணைப்பது.*

*சமையல் கலை மட்டும் அல்ல. குடும்ப கலாச்சாரத்தின் மையப்புள்ளி.*

*சமையல் அறை இல்லாது, வெறும் படுக்கை அறை மட்டும் இருந்தால் அது குடும்பம் அல்ல, தங்கும் விடுதி தான்.*

*சமையல் அறையை மூடிவிட்டு, படுக்கை அறை மட்டும் போதும் என்று நினைத்த அமெரிக்க குடும்பங்களின் நிலை என்ன?.*

*1971-ல் மொத்த குடும்பங்களில் கணவனும்-மனைவியும் குழந்தைகளுடன் இருந்த அமெரிக்க குடும்பங்கள் 71 சதவிகிதம்.*

*2020--ல் அது 20 சதவிகிதமாக நலிந்துவிட்டது.*

*அன்று வாழ்ந்த குடும்பங்களாக இருந்தது இன்று தங்கும் வீடுகளாகிவிட்டது.*

*அமெரிக்காவில் இப்போது பெண்கள் தனித்திருக்கும் வீடுகள் 15 சதவிகிதம்;*

*ஆண்கள் தனித்திருக்கும் வீடுகள் 12 சதவிகிதம்;*

*19 சதவிகிதம் வீடுகள் அப்பாவோ, அம்மாவோ மட்டுமே இருக்கும் வீடுகள்.*

*6 சதவிகிதம் வீடுகள் குடும்பங்கள் ஆண்--பெண் சேர்ந்து தங்குமிடங்கள்.*

*இன்று பிறக்கும் மொத்த குழந்தைகளில் 41 சதவிகிதம் திருமணமாகாத பெண்களுக்கு பிறக்கின்றன.*

*அதில் பாதி குழந்தைகள் பள்ளிக்கூடம் போகும் சிறுமிகளுக்கு,*

*இந்த அலங்கோலத்தால் அமெரிக்காவில் 50 சதவிகிதம் முதல் திருமணங்கள் விவாகரத்தில் முடிகின்றன.*

*67 சதவிகிதம் இரண்டாவது திருமணங்களும்,*

*74 சதவிகிதம் மூன்றாவது திருமணங்களும் விவகாரத்தாகின்றன.*

*வெறும் படுக்கை அறை மட்டும் குடும்பம் அல்ல.*

*சமையல் அறை இல்லாது, படுக்கை அறை மட்டும் இருந்தால்,*

*திருமணம் நிலை குலைந்துவிடும் என்பதற்கு அமெரிக்கா உதாரணம்.*

*அங்கு போல இங்கும் குடும்பங்கள் அழிந்தால் நமது பெண்ணுரிமைவாதிகள் கடைகளில் இனிப்பு வாங்கி வழங்கி கொண்டாடுவார்கள்.*

*குடும்பங்கள் அழிந்தால் மனநலமும் உடல் நலமும் சீரழியும்.*

*வெளியில் சாப்பிடுவதால் உடல் ஊதிப்போகிறது.*

*ஏராள தொற்று வியாதிகள் வருகின்றன.*

*சேமிப்பும் குறைகிறது.*

*எனவே சமையல், சமையல் அறை என்பது குடும்ப நலனுக்கு மட்டும் ஆதாரம் அல்ல.*

*உடல் நலம் மன நலம் பொருளாதாரத்துக்கு கூட அவசியம்.*

*ஆதலால் தான் நம்  வீட்டில் பெரியவர்கள் ஹோட்டல்களில்,*

*கிளப்பு கடைகளில் சாப்பிடுவதை தவிர்த்தும், கண்டித்தும் வந்தனர்.*

*ஆனால் இன்று நம்மிடையே குடும்பத்துடன் கடைகளில் சாப்பிடுவதும்...",*

*Swiggy, Zomato, uber eats போன்ற ஆன்லைனில் ஆர்டர் செய்து சாப்பிடுவதும்,*

*மெத்தப் படித்த, நடுத்தர மக்களிடமும் நாகரீகமாகிக்கொண்டிருக்கிறது.,*

*இது ஒரு பேராபத்து...*

[5/2/22, 12:27:13 AM] I C E Amma: "According to Psychologists, there are four types of Intelligence:

1) Intelligence Quotient (IQ)
2) Emotional Quotient (EQ)
3) Social Quotient (SQ)
4) Adversity Quotient (AQ)

1. Intelligence Quotient (IQ): this is the measure of your level of comprehension. You need IQ to solve maths, memorize things, and recall lessons.

2. Emotional Quotient (EQ): this is the measure of your ability to maintain peace with others, keep to time, be responsible, be honest, respect boundaries, be humble, genuine and considerate.

3. Social Quotient (SQ): this is the measure of your ability to build a network of friends and maintain it over a long period of time.

People that have higher EQ and SQ tend to go further in life than those with a high IQ but low EQ and SQ. Most schools capitalize on improving IQ levels while EQ and SQ are played down.

A man of high IQ can end up being employed by a man of high EQ and SQ even though he has an average IQ.

Your EQ represents your Character, while your SQ represents your Charisma. Give in to habits that will improve these three Qs, especially your EQ and SQ.

Now there is a 4th one, a new paradigm:

4. The Adversity Quotient (AQ): The measure of your ability to go through a rough patch in life, and come out of it without losing your mind.

When faced with troubles, AQ determines who will give up, who will abandon their family, and who will consider suicide.

Parents please expose your children to other areas of life than just Academics. They should adore manual labour (never use work as a form of punishment), Sports and Arts.

Develop their IQ, as well as their EQ, SQ and AQ. They should become multifaceted human beings able to do things independently of their parents.

Finally, do not prepare the road for your children. Prepare your children for the road."

[5/21/22, 2:26:05 AM] I C E Amma: A very informative post put out by Ajit George, ex-SBI Legal department.
(NO DOUBT VERY LENGTHY, BUT TO MY MIND WORTH INVESTING TIME)

Is Legal heir and Nominee the same?

I wonder how many of us are aware of this legal twist.
 
Read on...

Will your Nominee get the money on your death ?

Did you think that your nominee is the person, who will get all the money legally from your Life Insurance Policy and Mutual funds investments ?
Ha! That is exactly what you think if you are not aware of the legal aspects.
We assume a lot of things which sounds like they are obvious, but are not true from the legal point of view.

Today, we all concentrate on nominations in financial products.

For whom are we earning ?
For whom are we investing ?

Who, do we want to leave all our wealth to, in case something happens to us ?

It might be your children, your spouse, parents, siblings etc., or just a subset of these.
You also might want to exclude some people from your list of beneficiaries!.
So you think you will nominate person X in your Insurance policy, and when you are dead and gone, all the money goes to person X and he/she becomes the sole owner ? You are wrong, dude !
It does not work that way.

Let us see how it actually does!

What is a Nominee ?

According to law, a nominee is a trustee, not the owner of the assets.
In other words, he is only a caretaker of your assets.

The nominee will only hold your money/asset as a trustee and will be legally bound to transfer it to the legal heirs.

For most investments, a legal heir is entitled to the deceased’s assets.

For instance, Section 39 of the Insurance Act says the appointed nominee will be paid, though he may not be the legal heir.
The nominee, in turn, is supposed to hold the proceeds in trust and the legal heir can claim the money.

A legal heir will be the one who is mentioned in the will.
However, if a will is not made, then the legal heirs of the assets are decided according to the succession laws, where the structure is predefined on who gets how much.

For example, if a man during his lifetime executes a will... In the will, he mentions his wife and children as legal heirs, then after his death, his wife and children are the legal owners of his assets.

It is essential that one needs to execute a will.
It is the ultimate source of truth and replaces the succession law.

Nominee can also be one of the legal heirs.

Important :
Mention the Full Name, Address, age, relationship to yourself of the nominee.
Do not write the nomination in favour of wife and children as a class.
Give their specific names and particulars existing at that moment.
If the nominee is a minor, appoint a person who is a major as an appointee giving his full name, age, address and relationship to the nominee.

Why is the concept of Nominee ?

So you might be wondering, if the nominee does not become the sole owner, why does such a concept of a nominee exist at all ?

It is pretty simple. When you die, you want to make sure that the Insurance company, Mutual fund or your Shares should at least get out of the companies and go to someone you trust, and who can further help, in process of passing it to your legal heirs.

Otherwise, if a person dies and has not nominated anyone, your legal heirs will have to go through the process of producing all kind of certificates like death certificates, proof of relation etc., not to mention that the whole process is really cumbersome! (For each legal entity! The insurance company, the mutual funds, for the shares, for the real estate..) .
So, to simplify, if a nominee exists, these hassles do not happen, since the company is bound to transfer all your money or assets to the nominee.
The company then goes out of scene & then, it is between nominee and legal heirs.

*Example of Nomination* :

Ajay was 58 years old who died recently in an accident. As his children were settled, he wanted to make sure that his wife is the sole owner of all the monetary assets. This includes his insurance policy and mutual funds. So during his lifetime, he nominated his wife as a nominee in his term insurance policy and mutual funds investments. However, after Ajay’s death things did not turn up the way he wanted. The reason being Ajay did not leave a will. Though his wife was the nominee in all his movable assets, as per the law, his wife, along with children, were the legal heirs and all of them had equal right to Ajay’s assets.

One simple step which could have saved the situation was that Ajay should have made a will which clearly stated that only his wife was entitled to get all the money and not his children.

*Nomination in Saving/Current/FD/RD Account in Banks* :

FD’s also come with nomination facility. While opening a new account, there is a column for nomination in the same form and you should fill it. You can nominate two persons with first and second option. Note that in case you have not done any nomination till now, you should request Form No DA-1 from your Bank which is used to assign a nominee in future. (Examples of ICICI Bank , HDFC Bank , Canara Bank) .
In the same way to change/cancel the nomination, you need to fill up Form no DA-2.

*Read about Corporate Fixed Deposits* :

As per a famous case, A Bench of Justices Aftab Alam and R M Lodha in an order said that the money lying deposited in the account of the original depositor should be distributed among the claimants in accordance with the Succession Act of the respective community and the nominee cannot claim any absolute right over it.
Section 45ZA(2)(Banking Regulation Act) merely put the nominee in the shoes of the depositor after his death and clothes him with the exclusive right to receive the money lying in the account. It gives him all the rights of the depositors so far as the depositors account is concerned. But, it by no stretch of imagination make the nominee the owner of the money lying in the account, the Bench observed.

*NOMINATION IN PPF* :

Let me give you some shock first. If you have Rs 10 lakh in your public provident fund (PPF) account and you have not nominated anyone for your PPF account, your legal heirs will get maximum of Rs1 lakh only!
Yes, it is so important to have a nominee, now you get it .

You can nominate one or more persons as nominee in PPF. Form F can be used to change or cancel a nomination for PPF.
Also note that you cannot nominate anyone if you open an account for a minor.

*Nomination In Life Insurance* 

A policyholder can appoint multiple nominees and can also specify their shares in the policy proceeds. Nomination in life insurance has one limitation, as insurance policies are bought to secure your financial dependents, your first choice of nominee has to be your family members. In case you want to nominate a non-family member like a friend or third party, you will have to show/PROVE the insurance company that there is some insurable interest for the person. This happens because of a Clause called *PRINCIPAL OF INSURABLE INTEREST* in insurance. Note that provision of nomination in life insurance is related to Section 39 of the Insurance Act.

Note that as per LIC website –....

Nomination is a right conferred on the holder of a Policy of Life Assurance on his own life to appoint a person/s to receive policy moneys in the event of the policy becoming a claim by the assured’s death. The Nominee does not get any other benefit except to receive the policy moneys on the death of the Life Assured.
A nomination may be changed or cancelled by the life assured whenever he likes without the consent of the Nominee.

Make sure, you have a nominee for your policy for easy settlement of the claim, if you do not have any nominee mentioned in the policy, it can turn out to be a disaster for your dependents to get a claim.

*Nomination in Mutual Funds* :

In case of mutual funds, you can nominate up to three people, who can be registered at the time of purchasing the units. While filling in the application form, there is a provision to fill in the nomination details.

Even a minor can be a nominee, provided the guardian is specified in the nomination form.
You can also change nomination later by filling up a form which is available on the mutual fund company website.
Nomination in mutual funds is at folio level and all units in the folio will be transferred to the nominee(s). If an investor makes a further investment in the same folio, the nomination is applicable to the new units also.
A non-resident Indian can be a nominee, subject to the exchange control regulations in force from time to time.

*NOMINATION IN SHARES* :

Quiz for you...
Now you know what a Nominee means and who actually gets the money.
So if there is a husband H, with wife W and nephew N, and he has nominated his nephew N to be the nominee of his shares in demat account, who will have the legal right to own the shares after husband’s death ? If you answer is wife, you are wrong in this case!

In case of stocks, it does not work the usual way, if a will does not exist.

In the verdict, Justice Roshan Dalvi struck down a petition filed by Harsha Nitin Kokate, who was seeking permission to sell some shares held by her late husband.
The Court noted that as she was not the nominee, she had no ownership rights over the shares. Ms Kokate’s lawyer had argued that as she was the heir of her husband who had died intestate (without a will), she should have ownership rights of the shares, and be able to do anything with them as she wished.
In this case, Ms Kokate’s husband had nominated his nephew in favour of the shares. Justice Dalvi however noted that under the provisions of the Companies Act and the Depositories Act, Acts which govern the transfer of shares, the role of a nominee was different.

A reading of Section 109(A) of the Companies Act and 9.11 of the Depositories Act makes it abundantly clear that the intent of the nomination is to vest the property in the shares which includes the ownership rights there under in the nominee upon nomination validly made as per the procedure prescribed, as has been done in this case.

It means that if you have not written a will, anyone who has been nominated by you for your shares will be the ultimate owner of those stocks... The succession laws on inheritance will not be applicable... but, in case, you have made a will, that will be the source of truth.

*CONCLUSION* :

Now you know!
Taking Personal finance for granted can be fatal!!!!!

Just investing knowledge, is not enough to have a great financial life.
You also need to be well versed with basic legal aspects and make sure you carry out all due arrangement .

Nomination is one important aspect you should seriously consider, when checking for the financial products you have bought or plan to buy in future.

Mistakes in Personal Finance :

It’s important to make sure that your loved ones do not face legal issues and only say and think lovely thoughts about you when you are not around, rather than crib & grumble.

*Very Important message for all middle aged  people & Senior Citizens*.

[8/23/22, 8:43:06 AM] I C E Amma: *Drone take off from the summit of Mt. Everest*

With improvement in technology it was a matter of time that drones would fly higher than the summit of Mt. Everest. 

This climbing season DJI flew the Mavic 3 off the summit of Mt. Everest 8848m and the height clocked was 9232m. 

This is without doubt the most dramatic footage ever filmed from Mt. Everest beautifully stiched together in a 3 minute clip. 

Recommend watching in 4K on a large screen.

[9/13/22, 11:10:12 AM] Pappu: The past 4 days have been very stressful for me. 

Mom always talks ill of me with others. The other day she said that I am demanding more than 50% of the inheritance.  I have never done that, and yet she was publicly saying that about me. 

Now, I have actually said I want 50%. Mom is accusing me of being greedy for asking equal share. And mom has been yelling and having emotional outbursts. I am worried about her branding me as a villan behind my back to all relatives and friends.
[9/13/22, 11:14:42 AM] Pappu: Kutty - I find that you have become highly manipulative .

For 2 years mom was saying that she wanted to make sure that property reaches Brinda and Ravi safely. But within 4 days you  convinced her to sell off all the property one by one and turn over cash to you. 

You even told me that it is mom's own original idea. That is a lie.
[9/13/22, 11:18:10 AM] Pappu: On one side, I have a parent who thinks the worst of me, and on the other side I have a smooth talking manipulative sibling. 

It hurts
[9/13/22, 11:23:51 AM] Pappu: Kutty - you keep saying that you are not dependent on inheritance for survival,  yet you want to turn everything into cash as soon as possible. 
Your talk and actions don't match
‎[9/13/22, 11:36:40 AM] Prabha: ‎image omitted
[9/13/22, 11:37:51 AM] Pappu: I don't want to accept whatever is thrown my way and pretend everything is fair and square. 

There is no space for me to express myself with mom. 

I am unable to digest the hurt.
[9/13/22, 11:39:27 AM] Pappu: Family does not do this to you. 

Maybe time and space will heal me
[9/13/22, 11:39:54 AM] Pappu: I am leaving this group. 

Bye
[9/13/22, 11:40:33 AM] Pappu: Mom , if you need help, call me or send a text

[9/29/22, 5:59:30 AM] I C E Amma: At the age of 57, John B. Goodenough invented the lithium battery which powers all our smart phones, tablets and laptops - as well as electric cars.

37 years later at the age of 94, John has unveiled a new, ultra-efficient, low cost battery which uses a sodium or lithium coated glass electrolyte. It will dwarf his original invention and make it redundant.

The new glass battery will allow electric cars to go three times the distance, and recharge in minutes instead of hours. It's also far safer as it won't explode and can operate in sub-zero temperatures.

The new glass battery will power our future solar powered and electric vehicles, homes and industries.

But John isn't finished yet. He still works every day as a Professor at the University of Texas.

John believes humanity has a 30 year window to come up with an even more powerful "super battery" to take us entirely off fossil fuels, before the environmental damage we are creating becomes irreversible, and says, "I want to solve this problem before my chips are in ..... I still have time to go."

So if you ever think it's too late to be successful, just remember John B. Goodenough.

https://news.utexas.edu/2017/02/28/goodenough-introduces-new-battery-technology

It simply wasn't Good Enough for John Goodenough 😉

[10/12/22, 2:38:16 AM] I C E Amma: மனம் கவர்ந்த பதிவு…

“நான் ஒரு அமெரிக்க நிறுவனத்தில் பணிபுரிகிறேன். விடுமுறைக்காக வந்திருந்த போது ஒரு மணி நேரம் என் அப்பாவுடன் வங்கியில் கழித்தேன், ஏனெனில் அவர் கொஞ்சம் பணம் மாற்ற வேண்டியிருந்தது. என்னால் அமைதியாக இருக்க முடியாமல் ஒரு அறிவுரையை கூற முற்பட்டேன் ...

'' அப்பா, நீங்கள் ஏன் உங்கள் இணைய வங்கியை செயல்படுத்தக்கூடாது? '' என கேட்டேன்.

'' நான் ஏன் அதைச் செய்வேண்டும்? '' என்று கேட்டார் ...

'' சரி, நீங்கள் பணமாற்றம் போன்ற விஷயங்களுக்கு இங்கே ஒரு மணிநேரம் செலவிட வேண்டியதில்லை

உங்கள் ஷாப்பிங்கை ஆன்லைனில் கூட செய்யலாம். எல்லாம் மிகவும் எளிதாக இருக்கும்! '' என்றேன்.

நெட் பேங்கிங் உலகில் அவரைத் கொண்டு போக சொன்னதால் நான் மிகவும் உற்சாகமாக இருந்தேன்.

அவர் கேட்டார் நான் அவ்வாறு செய்தால், நான் வீட்டை விட்டு வெளியேற வேண்டியதில்லை

''ஆம் ஆம்''! நான் சொன்னேன். மளிகை சாமான்கள் கூட இப்போது வாசலில் எப்படி வழங்க முடியும் என்பதையும், அமேசான் போன்ற நிறுவனங்கள் நமக்கு தேவையான எல்லாவற்றையும் எவ்வாறு வழங்குகிறது என்பதை நான் அவரிடம் சொன்னேன்!

*அவரது பதில் என்னை பேசவிடாமல் என் நாக்கை கட்டியது*.

அவர் கூறினார்: '' நான் இன்று இந்த வங்கியில் நுழைந்ததிலிருந்து, எனது நான்கு நண்பர்களைச் சந்தித்தேன், இப்போது என்னை நன்கு அறிந்த ஊழியர்களுடன் சிறிது நேரம் உரையாடினேன்.

நான் தனியாக இருக்கிறேன் என்பது உனக்குத் தெரியும் ... இதுதான் எனக்குத் தேவையான நிறுவனம். நான் தயாராகி வங்கிக்கு வர விரும்புகிறேன். எனக்கு போதுமான நேரம் இருக்கிறது, அது நான் விரும்பும் மனத் தொடர்பு மட்டுமல்ல நெருங்கியவர்களுடன் நேரடித் தொடர்பு.

இரண்டு வருடங்களுக்கு முன்பு நான் நோய்வாய்ப்பட்டேன், நான் பழங்களை வாங்கும் கடை உரிமையாளர் என்னைப் பார்க்க வந்து என் படுக்கையில் உட்கார்ந்து என் நிலைக் கண்டு அழுதார்.

உங்கள் அம்மா தனது காலை நடைப்பயணத்தில் சில நாட்களுக்கு முன்பு கீழே விழுந்த போது. உள்ளூர் மளிகை கடைக்காரர் ஒருவர்தான் அவளைப் பார்த்தார், நான் வசிக்கும் இடத்தை அவர் அறிந்ததால் உடனடியாக அவரது காரில் நம் வீட்டிற்கு வந்து அழைத்துச் சென்றார்.

எல்லாம் ஆன்லைனில் மாறினால் எனக்கு அந்த 'மனித' தொடர்பு இருக்குமா?

எல்லாவற்றையும் எனக்கு வழங்குவதற்கும், நேரம் செலவழிக்கவும் எனது கணினியுடன் தொடர்பு கொள்ளும்படி என்னை ஏன் கட்டாயப்படுத்த வேண்டும்?

நான் 'விற்பனையாளரை' மட்டுமல்லாமல், நான் கையாளும் நபரை அறிய விரும்புகிறேன். இது உறவுகளின் பிணைப்புகளை உருவாக்குகிறது.

அமேசான் இதையெல்லாம் வழங்குகிறதா? ''

*தொழில்நுட்பம் வாழ்க்கை அல்ல ..*

*மக்களுடன் கொஞ்ச நேரத்தை செலவிடுங்கள் . எப்போதும் சாதனங்களுடன் அல்ல*"

[10/22/22, 9:43:50 PM] I C E Amma: Yes. I remember clearly how when India launched its first Rohini satellite in 1979, it was a failure and the BBC made a lot of fun saying India has launched a cartwheel rocket. Matter of irony that the very same Brits' satellites are being sent into the space by the same ISRO. I think India still has a record of the highest number of satellites in a single launch.

Eligibility: Less than $250,000 if you are single or married and file separately, 
Less than $500,000 if you file jointly or as a Head of Household.
Californians boast that they are puritans! This is also *a kind of dole* but no one has returned the gas money!

*Undocumented Californians are also eligible*
Funny country: They collect taxes from undocumented people and also pay them like this. But this information cannot be used in the court by the immigration dept to kick them out!  They also get pension aka social security!

[3/1/23, 7:47:53 AM] Pappu: You regularly do this

Or never call us for help.

[3/1/23, 7:51:19 AM] Pappu: And look at the way you talk today!
[3/1/23, 7:52:30 AM] Pappu: He has helped you like a son for 14 years 

You are quick to accuse me but the truth is You have no gratitude
[3/1/23, 7:58:23 AM] I C E Amma: I am thankful for  all the help you and Anand
[3/1/23, 7:59:45 AM] I C E Amma: I am sure you and Anand will  help if and when I  ask
[3/1/23, 8:01:02 AM] I C E Amma: I don't  want to trouble anyone unless it is absolutely  necessary
[3/1/23, 8:03:32 AM] I C E Amma: I only expect  love and respect from  the family
[3/1/23, 8:04:47 AM] Pappu: Please don't try to act diplomatic 

Both you and I know who you are
[3/1/23, 8:05:15 AM] I C E Amma: Thanks 🙏
[3/1/23, 8:05:22 AM] Pappu: This has never happened 

You have always spoken ill of me and my husband
[3/1/23, 8:06:01 AM] Pappu: And you have always spoken highly about kutty
[3/1/23, 8:06:23 AM] Pappu: Me and my husband are your servants
[3/1/23, 8:06:31 AM] Pappu: Kutty is your prince
[3/1/23, 8:09:13 AM] Pappu: Myself and my husband are the idiots
[3/1/23, 8:41:52 AM] Pappu: Yes

You dish out insults, yell at the top of your voice and speak low of us

But have premium expectations
[3/1/23, 4:39:10 PM] Pappu: Myself and Anand have responded to every single request of yours for the past 14 years 

We have achieved 6sigma (99.9%) in that.

Yet to tell the world that we are too busy to help you

You have practiced these lies so much that you have started tell me directly that I don't answer your calls and don't call you back as well

Every time I point out that you are telling lies
[3/1/23, 4:43:12 PM] Pappu: Time and again I have told you not to be so. Either acknowledge to the world that we respond to you every time. 

Or never call us and tell the world that you prefer not to call us.( Even in this case you can't tell the world we are too busy and don't respond)
[3/1/23, 4:43:49 PM] Pappu: Stick to truth

[3/3/23, 6:35:08 AM] Pappu: Hi

Because I asked mom to acknowledge that we do help her, mom said 
1. I cannot leave my kids at her house 
2. She will never call us for help
[3/3/23, 6:37:06 AM] Pappu: She also said that splitting properties, she will split however she likes.

I feel that mom and brother are cheating me

So be it
[3/3/23, 6:38:26 AM] Pappu: Both of you are hand in glove, kutty wants whatever is good, mom wants to give kutty whatever is good
[3/3/23, 6:40:32 AM] Pappu: And if I express ANYTHING,  mom tries to shut me up by yelling at the top of her voice
[3/3/23, 6:42:02 AM] Pappu: There is no "us"
[3/3/23, 8:00:07 AM] Pappu: Mom,

My husband says you called him and spoke behind my back. Don't do that.

He says you are old and does not want to argue with you. So he is keeping silent. Does not mean he is agreeing with whatever you are saying
[3/3/23, 8:03:17 AM] Pappu: I also asked him whether he told you to remain in your house because I don't allow you to be peaceful at my house - which is your version 

He said you kept on blaming me for everything and kept on talking,  so he said that he hoped you will drop the conversation if he says that
[3/3/23, 8:03:42 AM] Pappu: He agreed with me that you are the one yelling whenever you come to my house
[3/3/23, 8:04:07 AM] Pappu: We all put up with you

When it gets too much, I fight back
[3/3/23, 8:04:50 AM] Pappu: When you go out of your way to insult me, I stand up to you and demand why you do that
[3/3/23, 8:16:20 AM] Pappu: In fact, after kutty left India, Anand told me to cut off all communication with mom.

He said she is ill treating you, she is yelling at you
[3/3/23, 8:18:03 AM] Pappu: He witnessed about 25% of our property splitting, for that itself he said that
[3/3/23, 3:43:34 PM] Pappu: Anand came home and spoke to me last night. He says mom will never accept her fault. If I want peace, the only solution is for me to stay away.
He says he agreed to visit mom and listen to her, but in reality he has no intention of doing so. He only agreed to everything in the conversation because saying no makes no sense to mom, she will only keep justifying and continue talking.
[3/3/23, 3:47:28 PM] Pappu: And kutty,  I even tried what you said.
Even though mom was continually yelling,  I spoke in normal tone. It didn't make any difference. I  was patient with her for 1 hour. I will wait for her to finish her yelling and then I will talk in normal tone. Before I can complete 1 sentence,  she will start yelling again. She continued this for 1 hour.
[3/3/23, 4:19:59 PM] Pappu: And yesterday mom is declaring that as a daughter,  I have done no service to her.

I have put up with her, always dropped whatever she has said, always helped her out in times of need and sickness. I will move into her house with my kids whenever she is sick and take care. I will move back to my house only after she fully recovers.
[3/3/23, 4:22:29 PM] Pappu: She accidentally fell in bathroom 3 years ago. After that I made my husband buy a 3 bedroom house because I  felt she is getting older and I will need a room for her if her needs to move in. Thank God I did that. We could accommodate her when she dislocated her shoulder
[3/3/23, 4:23:16 PM] Pappu: Every time she has called me for help, I have gone and helped her
[3/3/23, 4:23:43 PM] Pappu: And she is saying I have NEVER been of use to her as a daughter
[3/3/23, 4:25:35 PM] Pappu: I think this is the way she is. Whatever I have done or will do will make no difference.

[3/22/23, 11:39:21 PM] I C E Amma: The elephant whispers movie Oscar award  வாங்கிய இந்த சமயத்தில் இதையும் தெரிந்து கொள்வோம்... 

முதல் படம் யானைகளுக்கு சமைப்பதற்க்கு பிரஸ்டீஜ் நிறுவணம் தயாரித்து கொடுத்த பிரத்யேக குக்கர் 

ஒரு யானையை பாதுகாப்பது என்பது 18 லட்சம் மரங்களை விதைத்தற்கு சமம்! 
– நரேஷ் க்ரீன்.

“ஒரு நாளைக்கு நீங்க எவ்ளோ சாப்பிடுவீங்க சார்? மிஞ்சிப்போனா ஒரு 5 கிலோ? எவ்ளோ தண்ணி குடிப்பீங்க? ரொம்ப அதிகமா ஒரு 8 லிட்டர்? நீங்க சாப்பிடுறதுனால, உங்களைத் தவிர வேற யாருக்காவது ஏதாவது நன்மை இருக்கா சார்..?”

யானைகள் அப்படி என்ன பெரிதாக செய்து விடுகிறது என்று கேட்கும் அறிவாளிகளுக்கு இதைவிட எளிமையாக என்னால் பதிலளிக்க முடியவில்லை. 

யானைகள் மிக எதார்த்தமான குழந்தைகள். யானை எனும் பேருயிரியின் மீதான என் காதல் அதிகரித்துக்கொண்டே செல்கிறது. 

யானைகள் குறித்த புத்தகம் ஒன்றும் தயாராகி வருகிறது. அந்த புத்தகத்தின் ஒரு சிறிய பகுதி இதோ..

“ஒரே ஒரு யானை சாப்பிடுறதுல இருந்து ஒரு காடே உருவாகும் சார். 

ஒரு யானை, ஒரு நாளைக்கு 200 – 250 கிலோ உணவு சாப்பிடும் சார். சராசரியா அதனோட உடல் எடையில இருந்து 5 சதவிகித உணவை சாப்பிடும். ஒரு நாளைக்கு ஒரு யானை 100 – 150 லிட்டர் தண்ணீர் குடிக்கும். 

இந்த 250 கிலோ உணவுங்கிறதுல, 10 சதவிகிதம் விதைகள் இருக்கும். அதாவது 25 கிலோ விதைகள், குச்சிகள் இருக்கும். அதுல கடைசிக்கும் கடைசியா 10 கிலோ விதைகளும் குச்சிகளும் திரும்ப மண்ணுல விதைக்கப்படும். 

நினச்சுப் பாருங்க, ஒவ்வொரு யானையும் ஒரு நாளைக்கு குறைந்தபட்சம் 10 கிலோ விதைகளை விதைக்குது சார்! எண்ணிக்கையில சொல்லணும்னா, சராசரியா ஒரு யானை ஒரு நாளைக்கு 300 – 500 விதைகளை விதைக்குது…”

வனவிலங்கு மருத்துவர் கலைவாணன் புள்ளி விவரங்களை சொல்லிமுடிக்கும் போது, அந்தப் பேருயிரிகளின் பிரமிக்க வைக்கும் பரிமாணத்தைப் புரிந்து கொள்ள முடிந்தது.

500 விதைகளில் குறைந்தது 100 விதைகளாவது முளைத்து விடும். இது மிகவும் குறைந்தபட்ச எண்ணிக்கை தான். 

அப்படியென்றால், ஒரு யானை ஒரு மாதத்திற்கு 3000 மரங்களை நடுகிறது. வருடத்திற்கு 36 ஆயிரத்து ஐநூறு மரங்கள். மொத்தமாகப் பார்த்தால் ஒரே ஒரு யானை தன் வாழ்நாளில் 18 லட்சத்து 25 ஆயிரம் மரங்கள் வளரக் காரணமாகிறது. மீண்டும் சொல்கிறேன், இது மிகவும் குறைந்தபட்ச எண்ணிக்கை தான்!

இன்னும் ஆச்சரியங்கள் காத்திருந்தன.

“இப்போ இவ்வளவு சாப்பிடணும்னா அது எவ்வளவு பயணம் செய்யணும்? இப்பல்லாம் நம்மளால இந்த இத்துனூண்டு உடம்ப தூக்கிட்டு 10 கிலோமீட்டர் கூட சேந்தாப்புல நடக்க முடியல. 

ஆனா ஒரு யானையால ஒரு நாளைக்கு 190 கிலோமீட்டர் நடக்க முடியும்னு ஆய்வுகள் சொல்லுது. சராசரியா ஒரு நாளைக்கு 30 கிலோமீட்டர் தூரம் யானைகள் நடக்கும். அதுவும் 4-5 மணி நேரத்துல.”

அப்படியென்றால் சராசரியாக மணிக்கு 15 லிருந்து 20 கிலோமீட்டர் வேகம். யானைகள் இவ்வளவு வேகமாக நடக்குமா என்று வியக்கும்போதே இன்னொரு தகவலையும் சொன்னார். 

யானைகள் மிக வேகமாக ஓடும். யானைகள் துரத்தினால் மனிதர்களால் ஓடித் தப்பிக்க முடியாது. மனிதர்களை விட 2 மடங்கு வேகத்தில் யானைகள் ஓடும்.

ஏன் 4-5 மணிநேரம் மட்டுமே நடக்கின்றன? மற்ற நேரங்களில் என்ன செய்யும்?

“சாப்புடும்” சிரித்துக் கொண்டே சொன்னார்.

அவ்வளவு நேரமுமா?

“ஒரு நாளைக்கு 12 – 18 மணி நேரம் சாப்பிட்டுகிட்டே இருக்கும் சார்.”

அப்போ தூக்கம்?

“யானைகள் இரண்டு மணி நேரம் மட்டுமே தூங்கும்.”

யானைகளை மிகவும் பிடிக்க ஆரம்பித்தது. இவ்வளவு பிரமிப்பானவையா அவை..?

“இன்னொரு சுவாரஸ்யமான தகவல் சொல்லட்டா சார்..? எந்த பாலூட்டிகளை விடவும் அதிகமான பேறு காலம் கொண்டவை யானைகள் தான் சார். 22 மாசம்!”

அம்மாடி..!

காடுகளின் மூதாய் யானைகள் தான். பழங்காலத்திற்கும் இன்றைய நவீன உலகுக்கும் உள்ள ஆதி உயிர்த் தொடர்புச் சங்கிலியின் எச்சம் இந்த யானைகள் தான்!

மரங்களை நடுவதைவிட, சுற்றி இருக்கும் உயிர்களை பாதுகாப்போம். அவ்வுயிர்களை விட நேர்த்தியாகவும் எளிமையாகவும் நம்மால் எதுவும் செய்துவிடமுடியாது

THOUGHT YOU COULD RELATE TO THIS!!

```.  *"THE ELDERLY"*

 "We were born in the 40-50-60."

 "We grew up in the 50-60-70's."

 "We studied in the 60-70-80."

 "We were dating in the 70-80-90's."

 "We got married and discovered the world in the 70-80-90's."

 We venture into the 80-90.

 We stabilize in the 2000s.

 "We got wiser in the 2010s."

 And we are going firmly through 2020.

 "Turns out we've lived through EIGHT different decades..."

 "TWO different centuries..."

 TWO different millennia...

 "We have gone from the telephone with an operator for long-distance calls to video calls to anywhere in the world, we have gone from slides to YouTube, from vinyl records to online music, from handwritten letters to email and WhatsApp."

 "From live matches on the radio, to black and white TV, and then to HD TV."
 We went to the Video Club and now we watch Netflix.

 'We got to know the first computers, punched cards, diskettes and now we have gigabytes and megabytes in hand on our cell phones or IPad."

 We wear shorts throughout our childhood and then long pants, oxfords, Bermuda shorts, etc.

 "We dodged infantile paralysis, meningitis, H1N1 flu and now COVID-19."

 We rode skates, tricycles, invented cars, bicycles, mopeds, gasoline or diesel cars and now we ride hybrids or 100% electric.

 "Yes, we've been through a lot but what a great life we've had!"

 They could describe us as “exennials”;  people who were born in that world of the fifties, who had an analog childhood and a digital adulthood.

 "We're kind of Yaheseen-it-all."

 Our generation has literally lived through and witnessed more than any other in every dimension of life.

 It is our generation that has literally adapted to “CHANGE”.

 A big round of applause to all the members of a very special generation, which will be UNIQUE." A precious and very true message that I received from a friend.

 *🏹🏹*TIME DOES NOT STOP*

       _"Life is a task that we brought ourselves to do at home._

       _When you look... it's already six in the afternoon;  when you look... it's already Friday;  when one looks... the month is over, when one looks... the year is over;  when one looks... 50, 60 and 70 years have passed!_
       _When you look... we no longer know where our friends are._
       _When you look... we lost the love of our life and now, it's too late to go back._
            Do not stop doing something you like due to lack of time.  Do not stop having someone by your side, because your children will soon not be yours, and you will have to do something with that remaining time, where the only thing that we are going to miss will be the space that can only be enjoyed with the usual friends.  That time that, unfortunately, never returns..."_
 *The day is today!*
 *WE ARE NO LONGER AT AN AGE TO POSTPONE ANYTHING.*

 Hopefully you have time to read and then share this message... or else leave it for *Later* and you will see that you will never share it!

 Always together
 Always united
 Always Brothers
 Always friends

 Pass it on to your old friends. Don’t leave it for later 😉😉😉```

[4/26/23, 9:49:32 PM] I C E Amma: Simple steps to happiness:

The beautiful, well-versed 83 year old lady, fully dressed every morning at 8 am sharp, with her hair done in fashion and perfectly applied makeup, is moving to a retirement home. Her husband recently died, which motivated her move.
After many hours of patiently waiting in the hall of the home, she smiled sweetly, when told her room was ready.

As she moved her walker toward the elevator, she was given a detailed description of her small room, including the curtains hanging from her window.
′′ I love it “, 

she said, with the enthusiasm of a 8-year-old girl who was just handed over a new pet.
- Mrs. Jones; you haven’t seen the room, just wait. - That doesn’t matter, she replied.
Happiness is something you decide over time. Whether or not I like my room doesn’t depend on how the furniture is arranged, it depends on how I arrange my mind.

I’ve already decided that I like it. It’s a decision I make every morning when I wake up. I have the choice; I can spend the day in bed, going through
the difficulty I have with my body parts
that don’t work, or get out of bed and be thankful for the parts that do work.

Every day is a gift, and as long as my eyes open, I will focus on the new day and the happy memories I’ve stored just for this time in my life.
HAPPINESS is like a bank account: you withdraw from it, what you deposit.

So my advice would be to deposit a lot of happiness into your memory account.
Remember these five simple things:
1. Free your heart from hate and discord. 2. Free your mind from worries.
3. Live simply.
4. Give more.
5. Take less.

Thanks for reading

[5/7/23, 10:57:25 PM] I C E Amma: Speech by Thomas Friedman in the New York Times.....

"When we were young kids growing up in America, we were told to eat our vegetables at dinner and not leave them. Mothers said, think of the starving children in India and finish the dinner.'

And now I tell my children : 'Finish your homework. Think of the children in India, who would become CEOs and make you starve, if you don't.'?"

[7/8/23, 8:08:52 AM] I C E Amma: *இந்தியாவின் சாதனைகள்...*

*🔺முதல் சாதனை :-* உலகின் சக்தி வாய்ந்த 25 நாடுகளின் பட்டியல் வெளியானது,,, இந்தியா 3வது இடத்தைப் பிடித்தது, அமெரிக்கா, ரஷ்யா நம்மை விட முன்னணியில் உள்ளன.

*🔺 இரண்டாவது சாதனை :-*
,,, ஜிஎஸ்டியின் மாதாந்திர வரி வசூல் 1.4- 1.5 லட்சம் கோடிகளைத் தாண்டியது,,,,, இதுதான்! ஒரு தேநீர் விற்பனையாளரின் பொருளாதாரம்

*🔺 மூன்றாவது சாதனை :-* புதிய சூரிய மின் உற்பத்தி நிலையங்களை அமைப்பதில், அமெரிக்கா மற்றும் ஜப்பானை பின்னுக்கு தள்ளி, இந்தியா இரண்டாவது இடத்தை அடைந்தது,,,,

*🔺 நான்காவது சாதனை :-*
2017-18ல் சூரிய சக்தி உற்பத்தி இரட்டிப்பாகியுள்ளது, சீனாவும் அமெரிக்காவும் திகைத்து நிற்கின்றன

*🔺 ஐந்தாவது சாதனை :-*
,,, இந்தியாவின் வானம் தொடுகிறது, மொத்த உள்நாட்டு உற்பத்தியில்,,, இந்தியாவின் ஜிடிபி 8.2%, சீனாவின் 6.7% மற்றும் அமெரிக்காவின் 4.2%! இந்தியாவின் மோடி ஏன் வெளிநாடு செல்கிறார் என்று இப்போதும் சொல்வார்கள்.

*🔺 ஆறாவது சாதனை :-* ,
  நீர், நிலம் மற்றும் வானம்; மூன்று பகுதிகளிலிருந்தும் சூப்பர்சோனிக் ஏவுகணைகளை ஏவிய உலகின் முதல் நாடு இந்தியா

*🔺 ஏழாவது சாதனை :-*
70 ஆண்டுகளில் பாகிஸ்தான் ஏழையாக காணப்படவில்லை, ஆனால் மோடி ஜி வந்தவுடன் பாகிஸ்தான் ஏழையாகிவிட்டது ,,,

*🔺 எட்டாவது சாதனை :-*
இதையும் படியுங்கள் ,,,,, ஒன்று புரியவில்லை,,, 2014ல் காங்கிரஸ் பாதுகாப்பு அமைச்சர் ஏ. ஆஃப். ஆண்டனி, நாடு ஏழ்மையில் உள்ளது, ரஃபேலை விட, சிறிய ஜெட் கூட வாங்க முடியாது, ஆனால் மோடிஜி ஈரானின் கடனை அடைத்தார், ரஃபேல் ஒப்பந்தத்தை முடித்துவிட்டார், எஸ்-400 ஐயும் எடுக்கிறார்! எல்லாவற்றிற்கும் மேலாக, காங்கிரஸ் காலத்தில் நாட்டின் பணம் எங்கே போனது,,, ❓

*🔺 ஒன்பதாவது சாதனை :-* ,,,
ராணுவத்திற்கு குண்டு துளைக்காத ஸ்கார்பியோ பாதுகாப்பு கவசம் கிடைத்தது,,, ஜம்மு காஷ்மீரில் ராணுவத்திற்கு 2500 குண்டு துளைக்காத ஸ்கார்பியோ கிடைத்துள்ளது.

*🔺 பத்தாவது சாதனை :-*
,,, இப்போது சொல்கிறேன், இந்த 4 ஆண்டுகளில் இந்தியாவின் வளர்ச்சி என்ன,,, பொருளாதாரத்தில் பிரான்ஸை பின்னுக்கு தள்ளி 6வது இடத்திற்கு தள்ளியது,,,

*🔺 பதினோராவது சாதனை :-* ,,, வாகன சந்தையில் ஜெர்மனியை பின்னுக்கு தள்ளி, 4வது இடத்தை பிடித்தது,,,

*🔺 பன்னிரண்டாவது சாதனை :-* ,,,, மின்சார உற்பத்தியில் ரஷ்யாவை பின்தள்ளி, 3வது இடத்தைப் பிடித்தது,,,

*🔺 பதின்மூன்றாவது சாதனை :-* ,,, *ஜவுளி உற்பத்தியில் இத்தாலியை பின்னுக்கு தள்ளி 2வது இடம் பிடித்தது,,,

*🔺 பதினான்காவது சாதனை :-* ,,, மொபைல் தயாரிப்பில் வியட்நாமை பின்னுக்கு தள்ளி 2வது இடத்தை பிடித்தது,,,

*🔺 பதினைந்தாவது சாதனை :-* ,,, எஃகு உற்பத்தியில் ஜப்பானை பின்தள்ளி, நம்பர் 2 ஆனது,,,

*🔺 பதினாறாவது சாதனை :-* ,,, சர்க்கரை உற்பத்தியில் பிரேசிலை பின்னுக்கு தள்ளி முதலிடத்தை பிடித்தது,,,

*🔺 பதினேழாவது :-* சாதனைகள்,,, எப்பொழுதும் உறங்கிக் கொண்டிருந்த இந்துக்களிடையே தேசியவாதத்தை எழுப்பியது, உலகம் முழுவதும் உள்ள 125 கோடி இந்துக்கள் என்று ஒரு தேசம் இல்லை! இந்தப் பணியை மிக முக்கியமானதாகக் கருதுகிறேன்.

*பயங்கரவாதிகள் ஒழிப்பு,,, 8 மாதங்களுக்குள், 230 பயங்கரவாதிகள் 72 மணிநேரத்திற்கு அருகில் நரகத்திற்கு அனுப்பப்பட்டனர்*
 
*தயவுசெய்து :--* 2 நிமிட நேரம் ஒதுக்கி, நாட்டின் நலன் கருதி இதைப் பகிரவும், குறிப்பாக மோடி ஜி மீது நம்பிக்கையில்லாத மக்களுக்கு.*

[7/22/23, 10:13:53 PM] I C E Amma: Interesting Poll

Here is an Interesting Eight - Question Survey with interesting national results. 

 

Questionnaire 

 

What percentage of the United States is black? 

 

What percentage of marriages are mixed race? 

 

What percentage of the United States is "Latino”? 

 

How many families make more than $500,000 per year? 

 

What percent of Americans are vegetarians? 

 

What percent of Americans live in New York City? 

 

What percentage of Americans are ‘transgender? 

 

The Poll Results 

This should be a wake-up call if you don't already know this.  A recent poll was conducted by a national polling outfit.  Names don't matter.  They are all the same.  This one was "YouGov.” 

 

Results to these questions asked of average people on the street: 

 

1.  What percentage of the country is black?   Street Answers -- 41%.   Actual -- 13%.    If you watch commercials, you would think it is 90%.

 

2.  What percentage of marriages are mixed race?  Street Answers — 50%.  Actual -- 1%.   If you watch commercials, you would think it is 90%. 

 

3.  What percentage is "Latino"? Street Answers — 39%.  Actual -- 17%. 

 

4.  How many families make more than $500,000 a year?   Street Answers -- 26%.  Actual figure —  1%.  We think a quarter of the country is rich.

 

5.  What percent of Americans are vegetarians?   Street Answers -- 30%.   Actual — 5%.

 

6.  What percent of Americans live in New York City?   Street Answers -- 30%.  Actual -- 3%.

 

7.  What percentage of Americans are 'transgender?   Street Answers —  22%.   Actual number .5% (that is POINT 5) 

 

So why do people have such inaccurate thoughts on these counts?  THE MEDIA!   The media runs race, gender, and wealth stories constantly.  Result?  You are being brainwashed by the national left with the media.  Hitler's propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels would be proud if he had half the success.  Disney just went full-on "gender.”  It will no longer welcome guests with the traditional "Welcome ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls.”  Why?   Because .5% of the population dictates to the other 99% (that would be the vast majority), and corporate America falls for it.  Next time you are thinking Americans have changed and not in a good way, remember, it's mostly fake.  It's all a lie.  Most people think just like you do but the media has brainwashed Americans with constant broadcasting of  LIES. It's called social engineering. It's here and it's effective.

[8/1/23, 8:42:50 PM] Pappu: Good morning!

Kutty told me (mom present) that if I want Trichy road plot, I can pay him 50% of the market value and keep it. I am taking up that offer. 

I enquired from 3 separate sources ( thambi chitappa, suganthi chitti and vasantha agencies owner), the market value is 15 lakhs per cent.

Total value of the plot is 3 C.

So I will pay kutty 1.5 C before 30th September  and I want that plot registered in my name. It will be taken out of common property.
[8/1/23, 8:45:32 PM] Pappu: If this is in agreement, let me know

Anand will start the process of getting money ready from different sources 

He needs around 2 months time
[8/2/23, 4:18:42 AM] Pappu: Mom,

If you think the 20 lakhs per cent is a good offer,  then decide to sell it to us

Also, after this I will never bring up this topic ( ie asking for this plot)
[8/2/23, 6:25:28 AM] Pappu: Mom,

I am completely OK with whatever decision you make  👍

Have to locate the plot based on this plan

[8/4/23, 1:02:47 AM] Pappu: 15 lakhs per cent multiplied into 12 is 1.8 C.

It is beyond our budget

Anyway,  Mrs. Vijaya knows a potential buyer. She will consult them and pass on their contact to me.
[8/4/23, 1:03:48 AM] Pappu: 15 lakhs per cent is verified with the engineer (in the previous )
[8/4/23, 1:04:12 AM] Pappu: Kutty,

[8/4/23, 3:27:35 AM] Pappu: Someone called up enquiring about the banker's colony plot

In the conversation, he says 1.5 years ago the rate was 13 lakhs. His wife told me earlier  about the sale too, but she had said it was 14 lakhs the previous
[8/4/23, 3:27:58 AM] Pappu: All further enquiries I will pass on to you
[8/4/23, 4:24:27 AM] Pappu: Yesterday kutty told me that his assets are 16 lakhs in excess

Today the value of his banker's colony plot has gone up from 60 lakhs to 180 lakhs 

So right now, 

His assets are 136 lakhs in excess
[8/4/23, 6:40:32 AM] Pappu: Hi

We can go to bharathi colony and find out the market price for the plot. My  friends are saying our estimate is not accurate. Ramanathan uncle's estimate may or may not  be correct.


If you want first hand information, you are welcome to come with us. 

I don't know whether I will be able to capture video and audio evidence tomorrow
[8/4/23, 8:10:51 AM] Pappu: I will come in person tomorrow morning,  we can all talk
[8/4/23, 8:11:38 AM] Prabha: Ok
[8/4/23, 8:12:38 AM] Prabha: Amma talked with Umashankar about Peelamedu plots. He said last sold price in the area is 18L per cent
[8/4/23, 8:13:50 AM] Pappu: Okay
[8/4/23, 8:14:54 AM] Pappu: Kindly give me Uma shankar uncle number, in case I go he will be able to help me locate the plot
[8/4/23, 8:16:05 AM] Pappu: In case I go, do you want to come so that you can get first hand information,  check the plot, etc
[8/4/23, 8:17:46 AM] Pappu: My interest is in getting first hand information,  I am not trying to prove anyone wrong

[8/4/23, 9:16:45 AM] I C E Amma: For Sulur Truchy road plot, I am willing to sell at 20L per cent (2 Crore payment) on the condition that all the payment is in white.
[8/4/23, 9:17:00 AM] I C E Amma: We can discuss this also tomorrow
[8/4/23, 1:19:01 PM] Pappu: ‎This message was deleted.
[8/4/23, 1:23:21 PM] Pappu: 1. Because balaji Nagar house is in my name, you and kutty were very clear I have to take it. Both of you were adamant that I didn't have a choice there.

Similarly,  banker's colony is in Prabhakar name and it will go fully and legally to him only. It is only fair that both of you have the same clarity here too
[8/4/23, 1:27:01 PM] Pappu: 2. Gold

The value in excel sheet is wrong

When weighed,

Thilaga = 762g
Prabha = 610g

I gave back 76 g to make it equal

So both Thilaga and Prabha have got 686 g of gold each 

I have also given him 48g for ancestral gold compensation- that is separate
[8/4/23, 1:27:49 PM] Pappu: 3. Sulur trichy road plot is being offered for sale
[8/4/23, 1:33:18 PM] Pappu: 4. That leaves us only 4 plots,

sulur skk Nagar, peelamedu,  industrial estate and santhosh Nagar

Kutty, out of these four, please tell the ones you want. I will take whichever you don't want 

If there is a difference in value, we will settle within this current year.  

Then this gets closed. We don't  have to carry it forward for several years.
[8/4/23, 2:21:12 PM] Pappu: I mean, whichever ones kutty wants out of the 4 plots, mom can leave them to him in her will. In the same way, mom can leave the whichever is left to me in her will
[8/4/23, 8:07:03 PM] Prabha: what time are you planning to come?

[8/5/23, 2:59:31 AM] Pappu: I spoke to Uma Shankar uncle, he says market price is 20 lakhs, but last sale was an emergency sale and it happened at 18 lakhs
[8/5/23, 3:00:25 AM] Pappu: Mom,

I think the fair market price is 20 lakhs, and you can take the call what to enter in excel sheet
[8/5/23, 3:03:37 AM] Pappu: Directions- burani colony- Anu cables- right turn, left turn- uma shankar house- right turn- opposite madrasa
‎[8/5/23, 3:12:00 AM] Pappu: ‎video omitted
[8/5/23, 3:39:54 AM] Pappu: I spoke to THE HINDU editor who lives next to the temple opposite our plot. He also bought from Nandakumar uncle few months after we bought the land.

He paid 60,000 per cent. He says only part payment was on paper.
[8/5/23, 3:42:05 AM] Pappu: So approximately our purchase price was 60,000 x 21 cents = 12,60,000+ 1,00,000 = 13.6 lakhs
[8/5/23, 3:51:09 AM] Pappu: Mom,

You said that if kutty had not given money, we would have lost the plot.

 I didn't want to say anything before Anand, so I kept quiet.

 I  agree that he was a support to you. But we would have never lost the plot. 

You had 20 lakhs in bank deposits. I definitely appreciate you being cautious in not using up the money. But we would have never lost the plot.
[8/5/23, 4:50:40 AM] Pappu: Kutty's contribution 4/13.6=29% 

I have taken efforts to seek the truth.

As you said, it is your will, your money and your property 

You have every right to be partial to your favorite child

Only because you said you will be fair and give me 50%, I came to your house

If you have no intention to be fair, I will not enter your house
[8/5/23, 5:31:17 AM] Pappu: Mom,

This is not about the money

This is about the way you ill treat me and insult me

If you don't value me, that is your view and your life

I don't have to put up with the way you treat me. 

I will never put up with insults in order to get wealth
[8/5/23, 5:33:29 AM] Pappu: Kutty, next india trip, please add me in the group
[8/5/23, 5:34:53 AM] Pappu: Till then I would like to live an abuse free life 

(Mom, call me when you need my help, I will come over, help you and leave)

[11/5/23, 9:14:37 PM] I C E Amma: DS owned banks and DS individuals control most of the US Feds across USA.
There is no single US Fed in USA  like Bharat's  RBI 

The Federal Reserve Banks of USA are not a part of the federal government.

 The Federal Reserve Banks are set up like private corporations. Member banks hold stock in the Federal Reserve Banks and earn dividends. Holding this stock does not carry with it the control and financial interest given to holders of common stock in for-profit organizations. The stock may not be sold or pledged as collateral for loans. Member banks also elect six of the nine members of each Bank's board of directors.

Now there is a move to collapse this multiple Fed Reserve banks system and take over under a single Fed Bank system controlled by JP Morgan and deep state entities.
